  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative autoimmune disease resulting from a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Hypovitaminosis D seems to contribute to MS susceptibility as both an environmental and a genetic risk factor. The aim of our study was to investigate the association of SNPs in CYP27A1, CYP24A1, and RXR- alpha genes, vitamin D status, and MS risk. We performed a nested case-control study on patients with multiple sclerosis and healthy controls. Serum 25(OH)D3 levels and genotyping of CYP27A1, CYP24A1, and RXR-alpha -SNPs were investigated both in MS patients and in healthy controls. Serum 25(OH)D3 levels were measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Molecular analysis was performed by real-time PCR. The distribution of genotypic and allelic frequencies was not significantly different between patients and controls, except for rs2248137 CYP24A1. In particular, CC genotype (C minor allele) showed a higher frequency in MS patients in comparison to healthy controls. Moreover, we observed significantly lower serum 25(OH)D3 levels in MS patients with CC genotype in comparison to MS patients with GG and GC genotype. The findings of our study suggest a role of rs2248137 CYP24A1 in multiple sclerosis risk.},

  abstract = {Characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that underlie human genetic traits and diseases. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We report novel defects of mitochondrial translation elongation factor Ts (EFTs), with high carrier frequency in Finland and expand the manifestations of this disease group from infantile cardiomyopathy to juvenile neuropathy/encephalopathy disorders. METHODS: DNA analysis, whole-exome analysis, protein biochemistry, and protein modeling. RESULTS: We used whole-exome sequencing to find the genetic cause of infantile-onset mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, progressing to juvenile-onset Leigh syndrome, neuropathy, and optic atrophy in 2 siblings. We found novel compound heterozygous mutations, c.944G{$>$}A [p.C315Y] and c.856C{$>$}T [p.Q286X], in the TSFM gene encoding mitochondrial EFTs. The same p.Q286X variant was found as compound heterozygous with a splice site change in a patient from a second family, with juvenile-onset optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia. Our molecular modeling predicted the coding-region mutations to cause protein instability, which was experimentally confirmed in cultured patient cells, with mitochondrial translation defect and lacking EFTs. Only a single TSFM mutation has been previously described in different populations, leading to an infantile fatal multisystem disorder with cardiomyopathy. Sequence data from 35,000 Finnish population controls indicated that the heterozygous carrier frequency of p.Q286X change was exceptionally high in Finland, 1:80, but no homozygotes were found in the population, in our mitochondrial disease patient collection, or in an intrauterine fetal death material, suggesting early developmental lethality of the homozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: We show that in addition to early-onset cardiomyopathy, TSFM mutations should be considered in childhood and juvenile encephalopathies with optic and/or peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, or Leigh disease.},

  abstract = {The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1*1501 has been consistently associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) in nearly all populations tested. This points to a specific antigen presentation as the pathogenic mechanism though this does not fully explain the disease association. The identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for genes in the HLA locus poses the question of the role of gene expression in MS susceptibility. We analyzed the eQTLs in the HLA region with respect to MS-associated HLA-variants obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We found that the Tag of DRB1*1501, rs3135388 A allele, correlated with high expression of DRB1, DRB5 and DQB1 genes in a Caucasian population. In quantitative terms, the MS-risk AA genotype carriers of rs3135388 were associated with 15.7-, 5.2- and 8.3-fold higher expression of DQB1, DRB5 and DRB1, respectively, than the non-risk GG carriers. The haplotype analysis of expression-associated variants in a Spanish MS cohort revealed that high expression of DRB1 and DQB1 alone did not contribute to the disease. However, in Caucasian, Asian and African American populations, the DRB1*1501 allele was always highly expressed. In other immune related diseases such as type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, asthma and IgA deficiency, the best GWAS-associated HLA SNPs were also eQTLs for different HLA Class II genes. Our data suggest that the DR/DQ expression levels, together with specific structural properties of alleles, seem to be the causal effect in MS and in other immunopathologies rather than specific antigen presentation alone.},

  abstract = {A body mass index (BMI) {$>$}22kg/m2 is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Aboriginal Australians. To identify loci associated with BMI and T2D we undertook a genome-wide association study using 1,075,436 quality-controlled single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped (Illumina 2.5M Duo Beadchip) in 402 individuals in extended pedigrees from a Western Australian Aboriginal community. Imputation using the thousand genomes (1000G) reference panel extended the analysis to 6,724,284 post quality-control autosomal SNPs. No associations achieved genome-wide significance, commonly accepted as P{$<$}5x10-8. Nevertheless, genes/pathways in common with other ethnicities were identified despite the arrival of Aboriginal people in Australia {$>$}45,000 years ago. The top hit (rs10868204 Pgenotyped = 1.50x10-6; rs11140653 Pimputed\_1000G = 2.90x10-7) for BMI lies 5' of NTRK2, the type 2 neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that regulates energy balance downstream of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R). PIK3C2G (rs12816270 Pgenotyped = 8.06x10-6; rs10841048 Pimputed\_1000G = 6.28x10-7) was associated with BMI, but not with T2D as reported elsewhere.

The top hit (rs11240074 Pgenotyped = 5.59x10-6, Pimputed\_1000G = 5.73x10-6) for T2D lies 5' of BCL9 that, along with TCF7L2, promotes beta-catenin's transcriptional activity in the WNT signaling pathway. Additional hits occurred in genes affecting pancreatic (KCNJ6, KCNA1) and/or GABA (GABRR1, KCNA1) functions. Notable associations observed for genes previously identified at genome-wide significance in other populations included MC4R (Pgenotyped = 4.49x10-4) for BMI and IGF2BP2 Pimputed\_1000G = 2.55x10-6) for T2D. Our results may provide novel functional leads in understanding disease pathogenesis in this Australian Aboriginal population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past decade genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been applied to aid in the understanding of the biology of traits. The success of this approach is governed by the underlying effect sizes carried by the true risk variants and the corresponding statistical power to observe such effects given the study design and sample size under investigation. Previous ASD GWAS have identified genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci; however, these studies were of only of low statistical power to identify GWS loci at the lower effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) {$<$}1.15). METHODS: We conducted a large-scale coordinated international collaboration to combine independent genotyping data to improve the statistical power and aid in robust discovery of GWS loci. This study uses genome-wide genotyping data from a discovery sample (7387 ASD cases and 8567 controls) followed by meta-analysis of summary statistics from two replication sets (7783 ASD cases and 11359 controls; and 1369 ASD cases and 137308 controls). RESULTS: We observe a GWS locus at 10q24.32 that overlaps several genes including PITX3, which encodes a transcription factor identified as playing a role in neuronal differentiation and CUEDC2 previously reported to be associated with social skills in an independent population cohort. We also observe overlap with regions previously implicated in schizophrenia which was further supported by a strong genetic correlation between these disorders (Rg\,=\,0.23; P\,=\,9\,\texttimes\,10-6). We further combined these Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) ASD GWAS data with the recent PGC schizophrenia GWAS to identify additional regions which may be important in a common neurodevelopmental phenotype and identified 12 novel GWS loci. These include loci previously implicated in ASD such as FOXP1 at 3p13, ATP2B2 at 3p25.3, and a 'neurodevelopmental hub' on chromosome 8p11.23. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an important step in the ongoing endeavour to identify the loci which underpin the common variant signal in ASD. In addition to novel GWS loci, we have identified a significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia and association of ASD with several neurodevelopmental-related genes such as EXT1, ASTN2, MACROD2, and HDAC4.},

In MS, neurological disability results from inflammation, demyelination, and ultimately, axonal damage within the central nervous system. The sustained inflammatory phase of the disease leads to ion channel changes and chronic oxidative stress. Several independent investigations have demonstrated mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in MS, as well as abnormalities in mitochondrial transport. These processes create an energy imbalance and contribute to a parallel process of progressive neurodegeneration and irreversible disability. The potential roles of mitochondria in neurodegeneration are reviewed. An overview of mitochondrial diseases that may overlap with MS are also discussed, as well as possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of MS and other neurodegenerative conditions.},

The absence of viable treatment options reflects the fact that the pathophysiology and genotypic causes of the disease are not well understood. The advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has made it possible to broadly investigate genotypic alterations driving phenotypic occurrences. Recent studies have associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two paralogous scaffolding proteins, NEDD9 and CASS4, and the kinase PTK2B, with susceptibility to late-onset AD (LOAD). Intriguingly, NEDD9, CASS4, and PTK2B have been much studied as interacting partners regulating oncogenesis and metastasis, and all three are known to be active in the brain during development and in cancer. However, to date, the majority of studies of these proteins have emphasized their roles in the directly cancer relevant processes of migration and survival signaling. We here discuss evidence for roles of NEDD9, CASS4 and PTK2B in additional processes, including hypoxia, vascular changes, inflammation, microtubule stabilization and calcium signaling, as potentially relevant to the pathogenesis of LOAD. Reciprocally, these functions can better inform our understanding of the action of NEDD9, CASS4 and PTK2B in cancer.},

Recent studies implicate a connection between synaptic plasticity deficits and compromised capacity of de novo protein synthesis in AD. The mRNA translational factor eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) is critically involved in several forms of long-lasting synaptic plasticity. By examining postmortem human brain samples, a transgenic mouse model, and application of synthetic human A{$\beta$}42 on mouse hippocampal slices, we demonstrated that eEF1A protein levels were significantly decreased in AD, particularly in the hippocampus. In contrast, brain levels of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 were unaltered in AD. Further, upregulation of eEF1A expression by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, which induces long-lasting synaptic plasticity, was blunted in hippocampal slices derived from Tg2576 AD model mice. Finally, A{$\beta$}-induced hippocampal long-term potentiation defects were alleviated by upregulation of eEF1A signaling via brain-specific knockdown of the gene encoding tuberous sclerosis 2. In summary, our findings suggest a strong correlation between the dysregulation of eEF1A synthesis and AD-associated synaptic failure. These findings provide insights into the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying AD etiology and may aid in identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

Moreover, it has been established that eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) plays a critical role in maintaining long-term synaptic plasticity, a cellular model for learning and memory. The aim of the present study is to determine whether brain eEF1A protein levels are dysregulated in brain tissue from AD patients compared with controls. METHODS: Postmortem human brain samples collected from patients clinically diagnosed as AD, and from age-matched healthy controls, were utilized for this study. Both Western blot and immunohistochemistry approaches were utilized to investigate the potential alteration of eEF1A protein levels by using a specific antibody. RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that eEF1A expression is reduced in AD patients in the hippocampus, but not in the cerebellum or midfrontal gyrus. Furthermore, immunohistochemical experiments reveal that neuronal eEF1A reduction in the AD hippocampus is localized to the CA1 and dentate gyrus, but not to the CA3. CONCLUSION: Dysregulation of eEF1A and its associated signaling pathways might represent novel molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether eEF1A is a viable therapeutic target for AD and other cognitive syndromes.},

We performed a genome-wide association study and analysis of known genetic risk loci for AD dementia using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Neuropathologic data were used to define clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assess core neuropathologic features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs), and evaluate commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD with a number of variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). GalNAc transferase 7 (GALNT7), ATP-Binding Cassette, Sub-Family G (WHITE), Member 1 (ABCG1), and an intergenic region on chromosome 9 were associated with NP score; and Potassium Large Conductance Calcium-Activated Channel, Subfamily M, Beta Member 2 (KCNMB2) was strongly associated with HS. Twelve of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were confirmed in our clinico-pathologic sample: CR1, BIN1, CLU, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, CD33, PTK2B, SORL1, MEF2C, ZCWPW1, and CASS4 with 9 of these 12 loci showing larger odds ratio in the clinico-pathologic sample. Correlation of effect sizes for risk of AD dementia with effect size for NFTs or NPs showed positive correlation, while those for risk of VBI showed a moderate negative correlation. The other co-morbid neuropathologic features showed only nominal association with the known AD loci. Our results discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features and aligned known genetic risk for AD dementia with specific neuropathologic changes in the largest brain autopsy study of AD and related dementias.},

Here, we employed a novel combination of molecular strategies to find the responsible gene and show its effects in an animal model. Utilizing only three unrelated affected individuals and their relatives, we used homozygosity mapping with single-nucleotide polymorphism chips to localize AMRF. We then used microarray-expression analysis to prioritize candidates prior to sequencing. The disorder was mapped to 4q13-21, and microarray-expression analysis identified SCARB2/Limp2, which encodes a lysosomal-membrane protein, as the likely candidate. Mutations in SCARB2/Limp2 were found in all three families used for mapping and subsequently confirmed in two other unrelated AMRF families. The mutations were associated with lack of SCARB2 protein. Reanalysis of an existing Limp2 knockout mouse showed intracellular inclusions in cerebral and cerebellar cortex, and the kidneys showed subtle glomerular changes. This study highlights that recessive genes can be identified with a very small number of subjects. The ancestral lysosomal-membrane protein SCARB2/LIMP-2 is responsible for AMRF. The heterogeneous pathology in the kidney and brain suggests that SCARB2/Limp2 has pleiotropic effects that may be relevant to understanding the pathogenesis of other forms of glomerulosclerosis or collapse and myoclonic epilepsies.},

  abstract = {Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc-dependent peptidase responsible for converting angiotensin I into the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. However, ACE is a relatively nonspecific peptidase that is capable of cleaving a wide range of substrates. Because of this, ACE and its peptide substrates and products affect many physiologic processes, including blood pressure control, hematopoiesis, reproduction, renal development, renal function, and the immune response. The defining feature of ACE is that it is composed of two homologous and independently catalytic domains, the result of an ancient gene duplication, and ACE-like genes are widely distributed in nature. The two ACE catalytic domains contribute to the wide substrate diversity of ACE and, by extension, the physiologic impact of the enzyme. Several studies suggest that the two catalytic domains have different biologic functions. Recently, the X-ray crystal structure of ACE has elucidated some of the structural differences between the two ACE domains. This is important now that ACE domain-specific inhibitors have been synthesized and characterized. Once widely available, these reagents will undoubtedly be powerful tools for probing the physiologic actions of each ACE domain. In turn, this knowledge should allow clinicians to envision new therapies for diseases not currently treated with ACE inhibitors.},

  abstract = {The adaptor protein TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) serves as a powerful negative regulator in multiple aspects of B cell biology. Early in vitro studies in transformed cell lines suggested the potential of TRAF3 to inhibit signaling by its first identified binding receptor, CD40. However, because the canonical TRAF3 binding site on many receptors also mediates binding of other TRAFs, and whole-mouse TRAF3 deficiency is neonatally lethal, an accurate understanding of TRAF3's specific functions was delayed until conditional TRAF3-deficient mice were produced. Studies of B cell-specific TRAF3-deficient mice, complemented by investigations in normal and malignant mouse and human B cells, reveal that TRAF3 has powerful regulatory roles that are unique to this TRAF, as well as functions context-specific to the B cell. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of these roles and functions. These include inhibition of signaling by plasma membrane receptors, negative regulation of intracellular receptors, and restraint of cytoplasmic NF- {$\kappa$}B pathways. TRAF3 is also now known to function as a resident nuclear protein, and to impact B cell metabolism. Through these and additional mechanisms TRAF3 exerts powerful restraint upon B cell survival and activation. It is thus perhaps not surprising that TRAF3 has been revealed as an important tumor suppressor in B cells. The many and varied functions of TRAF3 in B cells, and new directions to pursue in future studies, are summarized and discussed here.},

  abstract = {Methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBD) mediate functional responses of methylated DNA. MBD2 and MBD3 are components of the MeCP1 protein complex, which contains the Mi-2/NuRD complex and includes 66- and 68-kDa polypeptides. Here we identified two highly related 66-kDa proteins in a yeast two-hybrid screen with MBD2b. Based on the high degree of sequence conservation to the previously identified Xenopus p66 subunit of the Mi-2/NuRD complex, we termed these proteins hp66alpha and hp66beta. hp66alpha is the human orthologue of Xenopus p66, whereas hp66beta, previously identified as a component of the human MeCP1 complex, is a second member of a p66 gene family. Coprecipitation of hp66alpha and MBD2 demonstrates their in vivo association. Furthermore, confocal microscopy shows a nuclear colocalization of hp66alpha with hp66beta and MBD2 in a speckled pattern. hp66alpha is a potent transcriptional repressor reducing gene activity about 100-fold and is ubiquitously coexpressed with hp66beta in cell lines and in fetal and adult tissues. We demonstrate direct binding of both p66 family members to MBD2 as well as MBD3. Interestingly, hp66alpha, which binds with a higher affinity than hp66beta, interacts via two interaction domains in contrast to a single interaction domain present in hp66beta. These results demonstrate that two highly related mammalian p66 proteins display overlapping functions and are involved in methylation dependent transcriptional repression.},

  abstract = {G2E3 was originally described as a G2/M-specific gene with DNA damage responsive expression. The presence of a conserved HECT domain within the carboxy-terminus of the protein indicated that it likely functions as a ubiquitin ligase or E3. Although HECT domains are known to function in this capacity for many proteins, we demonstrate that a portion of the HECT domain from G2E3 plays an important role in the dynamic subcellular localization of the protein. We have shown that G2E3 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein with nuclear export mediated by a novel nuclear export domain that functions independently of CRM1. In full-length G2E3, a separate region of the HECT domain suppresses the function of the NES. Additionally, G2E3 contains a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) in its amino terminus. Localization of G2E3 to the nucleolus is a dynamic process, and the protein delocalizes from the nucleolus rapidly after DNA damage. Cell cycle phase-specific expression and highly regulated subcellular localization of G2E3 suggest a possible role in cell cycle regulation and the cellular response to DNA damage.},

CR1 encodes a large transmembrane receptor with a crucial role in the immune complement cascade. We performed a genetic follow-up of the GWA CR1 association in a Flanders-Belgian cohort (n=1883), and investigated the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the CR1 locus on AD risk and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels. We obtained significant association (P(adj){$<$}0.03; odds ratio (OR)=1.24 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.51)) for one CR1 risk haplotype, and haplotype association was strongest in individuals carrying apolipoprotein E (APOE) {$\varepsilon$}4 alleles (P(adj){$<$}0.006; OR=1.50 (95\% CI: 1.08-2.09)). Also, four SNPs correlated with increased CSF amyloid A{$\beta_{1-42}$} levels, suggesting a role for the CR1 protein in A{$\beta$} metabolism. Moreover, we quantified a low-copy repeat (LCR)-associated copy number variation (CNV) in CR1, producing different CR1 isoforms, CR1-F and CR1-S, and obtained significant association in carriers of CR1-S. We replicated the CR1 CNV association finding in a French cohort (n=2003) and calculated in the combined cohorts, an OR of 1.32; 95\% CI: 1.10-1.59 (P=0.0025). Our data showed that the common AD risk association may well be explained by the presence of CR1-S increasing the number of C3b/C4b and cofactor activity sites and AD risk with 30\% in CR1-S carriers. How precisely the different functional role of CR1-S in the immune complement cascade contributes to AD pathogenesis will need additional functional studies.},

Our model extends existing generic workflow and bioinformatics models to describe workflows compactly and unambiguously.

In progressive MS, however, there is a gathering body of evidence indicating that molecular changes converge on mitochondria within neuronal cell bodies.

The resulting energy failure state is coupled with an increase in demand for energy by the demyelinated axon, being particularly relevant to the long tracts such as corticospinal tracts with long projection axons. Recent work in our laboratory and that of our collaborators indicates the limited reflection of the mitochondria changes within neurons in experimental disease models.

We aimed to investigate the association between MAPT haplotype status and brain morphology in healthy adults. A total of 150 healthy subjects underwent 3D high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR). MR images were processed following an optimized protocol to perform the Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) comparisons of the gray matter (GM) in H1 carriers (n=141) in contrast to H2H2 homozygous (n=9), and H1H1 homozygous (n=85) in contrast to H2 carriers (n=65). The threshold for statistical significance was 0.005 uncorrected. Opposite comparisons were also carried out. The groups had similar demographic and cognitive features. Compared with H2H2, the H1 carriers showed up to 19\% smaller GM volume in the head of the right caudate nucleus, in the right middle frontal gyrus, in the left insula and orbito-frontal cortex, and in the inferior temporal and inferior cerebellar lobes, bilaterally. Compared with all H2 carriers, H1H1 displayed lower GM in the same regions, but the effect was smaller (5\%), possibly due to a dilution effect by H1 in the H2 carriers group. The data suggest that H1 haplotype is associated with a particular cerebral morphology that may increase the susceptibility of the healthy carriers to develop neurodegenerative diseases such as sporadic tauopathies.},

Currently, the role of EEF1A2 in normal cardiac development and function is unclear. There have been several reports linking de novo dominant EEF1A2 mutations to neurological issues in humans. We report a pair of siblings carrying a homozygous missense mutation p.P333L in EEF1A2 who exhibited global developmental delay, failure to thrive, dilated cardiomyopathy and epilepsy, ultimately leading to death in early childhood. A third sibling also died of a similar presentation, but DNA was unavailable to confirm the mutation. Functional genomic analysis was performed in S. cerevisiae and zebrafish. In S. cerevisiae, there was no evidence for a dominant-negative effect. Previously identified putative de novo mutations failed to complement yeast strains lacking the EEF1A ortholog showing a major growth defect. In contrast, the introduction of the mutation seen in our family led to a milder growth defect. To evaluate its function in zebrafish, we knocked down eef1a2 expression using translation blocking and splice-site interfering morpholinos. EEF1A2-deficient zebrafish had skeletal muscle weakness, cardiac failure and small heads. Human EEF1A2 wild-type mRNA successfully rescued the morphant phenotype, but mutant RNA did not. Overall, EEF1A2 appears to be critical for normal heart function in humans, and its deficiency results in clinical abnormalities in neurologic function as well as in skeletal and cardiac muscle defects.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Loss of function mutations of CYP24A1 gene, which is involved in vitamin D catabolism, cause vitamin D-mediated PTH-independent hypercalcemia. The phenotype varies from life-threatening forms in the infancy to milder forms in the adulthood. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 17-year-old woman with a history of nephrolithiasis, mild PTH-independent hypercalcemia (10,5mg/dL), and high serum 1,25(OH)(2)D concentrations (107pg/mL). Other causes of hypercalcemia associated with the above biochemical signature were excluded. Family history revealed nephrolithiasis in the sister. Blood testing in first-degree relatives showed serum PTH in the low-normal range and 1,25(OH)(2)D at the upper normal limit or slightly elevated. The CYP24A1 gene analysis revealed a known homozygous loss-of-function pathogenic variant (c.428\_430delAAG, rs777676129, p.Glu143del). The panel of vitamin D metabolites evaluated by liquid chromatography showed the typical profile of CYP24A1 mutations, namely, low 24,25(OH)(2)D(3), elevated 25(OH)D(3):24,25(OH)(2)D(3) ratio, and undetectable 1,24,25(OH)(3)D(3). The parents and both the siblings harbored the same variant in heterozygosis. We decided for a watchful waiting approach and the patient remained clinically and biochemically stable over a 24-month followup. CONCLUSION: CYP24A1 gene mutations should be considered in cases of PTH-independent hypercalcemia, once that more common causes (hypercalcemia of malignancy, granulomatous diseases, and vitamin D intoxication) have been ruled out.},

  abstract = {Gallbladder cancer (GC) is a relatively uncommon cancer with higher incidence in certain areas including Japan. Because of the difficulty in diagnosis, prognosis of GC is very poor. To identify genetic determinants of GC, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 41 GC patients and 866 controls. Association between each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with GC susceptibility was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis conditioned on age and gender of subjects. SNPs that showed suggestive association (P{$<$}1 \texttimes{} 10(-4)) with GC were further examined in 30 cases and 898 controls. SNP rs7504990 in the DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer, 18q21.3) that encodes a netrin 1 receptor achieved a combined P-value of 7.46 \texttimes{} 10(-8) (OR=6.95; 95\% CI=3.43-14.08). Subsequent imputation analysis identified multiple SNPs with similarly strong associations in an adjacent genomic region, where loss of heterozygosity was reported in GC and other cancers. Reduced expression of DCC was indicated to be associated with the poorly differentiated histological type, increased proliferation and metastasis through loss of adhesiveness. However, due to the limited sample size investigated here, further replication study and functional analysis would be necessary to further confirm the result of the association.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the aggregation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein protein and selective death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Although the molecular pathogenesis of PD is not completely understood, a recent study has reported that eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) declined in the PD-affected brain. Therefore, the roles of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 in the prevention of DA neuronal cell death in PD are aimed to be investigated. Herein, by using Caenorhabditis elegans as a PD model, we investigated the role of eft-3/eft-4, the worm homolog of eEF1A1/eEF1A2, on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced DA neuron degeneration. Our results demonstrated that the expressions of eft-3 and eft-4 were decreased in the 6-OHDA-induced worms. RNA interference (RNAi) of eft-3 and eft-4 resulted in dramatic exacerbation of DA neurodegeneration induced by 6-OHDA, as well as aggravated the food-sensing behavior, ethanol avoidance, and decreased lifespan when compared with only 6-OHDA-induced worms. Moreover, downregulation of eft-3/4 in 6-OHDA-induced worms suppressed the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, including PI3K/age-1, PDK-1/pdk-1, mTOR/let-363, and AKT-1,2/akt-1,2, promoting the expression of apoptotic genes such as BH3/egl-1 and Caspase-9/ced-3. Collectively, these findings indicate that eEF1A plays an important role in the 6-OHDA-induced neurodegeneration through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and that eEF1A isoforms may be a novel and effective pro-survival factor in protective DA neurons against toxin-induced neuronal death.},

  abstract = {Background PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. Findings To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, \textbackslash documentclass[12pt]\{minimal\} 				\textbackslash usepackage\{amsmath\} 				\textbackslash usepackage\{wasysym\}  				\textbackslash usepackage\{amsfonts\}  				\textbackslash usepackage\{amssymb\}  				\textbackslash usepackage\{amsbsy\} 				\textbackslash usepackage\{mathrsfs\} 				\textbackslash usepackage\{upgreek\} 				\textbackslash setlength\{\textbackslash oddsidemargin\}\{-69pt\} 				\textbackslash begin\{document\} \$O\textbackslash left (\textbackslash sqrt \{n\}\textbackslash right)\$ \textbackslash end\{document\}On-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0). Conclusions The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility.

  abstract = {Genetic roots of multiple sclerosis The genetics underlying who develops multiple sclerosis (MS) have been difficult to work out. Examining more than 47,000 cases and 68,000 controls with multiple genome-wide association studies, the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium identified more than 200 risk loci in MS (see the Perspective by Briggs). Focusing on the best candidate genes, including a model of the major histocompatibility complex region, the authors identified statistically independent effects at the genome level. Gene expression studies detected that every major immune cell type is enriched for MS susceptibility genes and that MS risk variants are enriched in brain-resident immune cells, especially microglia. Up to 48\% of the genetic contribution of MS can be explained through this analysis. Science, this issue p. eaav7188; see also p. 1383 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that often presents in young adults. Over the past decade, certain elements of the genetic architecture of susceptibility have gradually emerged, but most of the genetic risk for MS remained unknown. RATIONALEEarlier versions of the MS genetic map had highlighted the role of the adaptive arm of the immune system, implicating multiple different T cell subsets. We expanded our knowledge of MS susceptibility by performing a genetic association study in MS that leveraged genotype data from 47,429 MS cases and 68,374 control subjects. We enhanced this analysis with an in-depth and comprehensive evaluation of the functional impact of the susceptibility variants that we uncovered. RESULTSWe identified 233 statistically independent associations with MS susceptibility that are genome-wide significant. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains 32 of these associations, and one, the first MS locus on a sex chromosome, is found in chromosome X. The remaining 200 associations are found in the autosomal non-MHC genome. Our genome-wide partitioning approach and large-scale replication effort allowed the evaluation of other variants that did not meet our strict threshold of significance, such as 416 variants that had evidence of statistical replication but did not reach the level of genome-wide statistical significance. Many of these loci are likely to be true susceptibility loci. The genome-wide and suggestive effects jointly explain \textasciitilde 48\% of the estimated heritability for MS.Using atlases of gene expression patterns and epigenomic features, we documented that enrichment for MS susceptibility loci was apparent in many different immune cell types and tissues, whereas there was an absence of enrichment in tissue-level brain profiles. We extended the annotation analyses by analyzing new data generated from human induced pluripotent stem cell\textendash derived neurons as well as from purified primary human astrocytes and microglia, observing that enrichment for MS genes is seen in human microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, but not in astrocytes or neurons. Further, we have characterized the functional consequences of many MS susceptibility variants by identifying those that influence the expression of nearby genes in immune cells or brain. Last, we applied an ensemble of methods to prioritize 551 putative MS susceptibility genes that may be the target of the MS variants that meet a threshold of genome-wide significance. This extensive list of MS susceptibility genes expands our knowledge more than twofold and highlights processes relating to the development, maturation, and terminal differentiation of B, T, natural killer, and myeloid cells that may contribute to the onset of MS. These analyses focus our attention on a number of different cells in which the function of MS variants should be further investigated.Using reference protein-protein interaction maps, these MS genes can also be assembled into 13 communities of genes encoding proteins that interact with one another; this higher-order architecture begins to assemble groups of susceptibility variants whose functional consequences may converge on certain protein complexes that can be prioritized for further evaluation as targets for MS prevention strategies. CONCLUSIONWe report a detailed genetic and genomic map of MS susceptibility, one that explains almost half of this disease's heritability. We highlight the importance of several cells of the peripheral and brain resident immune systems\textemdash implicating both the adaptive and innate arms\textemdash in the translation of MS genetic risk into an auto-immune inflammatory process that targets the CNS and triggers a neurodegenerative cascade. In particular, the myeloid component highlights a possible role for microglia that requires further investigation, and the B cell component connects to the narrative of effective B cell\textendash directed therapies in MS. These insights set the stage for a new generation of functional studies to uncover the sequence of molecular events that lead to disease onset. This perspective on the trajectory of disease onset will lay the foundation for developing primary prevention strategies that mitigate the risk of developing MS. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/365/6460/eaav7188/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint The MS genetic map implicates microglia as well as multiple different peripheral immune cell populations in the onset of the disease.We list some of the immune cells in which we found an excess of MS susceptibility genes, implicating these cells as contributing to the earliest events that trigger MS. The sample size of our genome-wide association study is listed along with a circus plot illustrating main results. We analyzed genetic data of 47,429 multiple sclerosis (MS) and 68,374 control subjects and established a reference map of the genetic architecture of MS that includes 200 autosomal susceptibility variants outside the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), one chromosome X variant, and 32 variants within the extended MHC. We used an ensemble of methods to prioritize 551 putative susceptibility genes that implicate multiple innate and adaptive pathways distributed across the cellular components of the immune system. Using expression profiles from purified human microglia, we observed enrichment for MS genes in these brain-resident immune cells, suggesting that these may have a role in targeting an autoimmune process to the central nervous system, although MS is most likely initially triggered by perturbation of peripheral immune responses.

  abstract = {![Figure][1]{$<$}/img{$>$} Genetic variants may lead to disease, denoted here by a dimmed letter representing a nucleotide. The PsychENCODE Consortium presents research to link the effects of genetic variation to gene expression in the brain. ILLUSTRATION: V. ALTOUNIAN/ SCIENCE  The brain, our most complex organ, is at the root of both the cognitive and behavioral repertoires that make us unique as a species and underlies susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. Healthy brain development and neurological function rely on precise spatiotemporal regulation of the transcriptome, which varies substantially by brain region and cell type. Recent advances in the genetics of neuropsychiatric disorders reveal a highly polygenic risk architecture involving contributions of multiple common variants with small effects and rare variants with a range of effects. Because most of this genetic variation resides in noncoding regions of the genome, establishment of mechanistic links between variants and disease phenotypes is impeded by a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory and epigenomic landscape of the human brain. To address this matter, the PsychENCODE Consortium was established in 2015 by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to characterize the full spectrum of genomic elements active within the human brain and to elucidate their roles in development, evolution, and neuropsychiatric disorders. To reach this objective, a multidisciplinary team of investigators across 15 research institutes has generated an integrative atlas of the human brain by analyzing transcriptomic, epigenomic, and genomic data of postmortem adult and developing human brains at both the tissue and single-cell levels. Samples from more than 2000 individuals were phenotypically characterized as neurotypical or diagnosed with schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or bipolar disorder. In Science, Science Translational Medicine , and Science Advances , we present manuscripts that provide insights into the biology of the developing, adult, and diseased human brain. These papers are organized around three flagship articles, the first analyzing human development, the second examining disease transcriptomes, and the third describing integration of tissue and single-cell data with deep-learning approaches. The consortium's integrative genomic analyses elucidate the mechanisms by which cellular diversity and patterns of gene expression change throughout development and reveal how neuropsychiatric risk genes are concentrated into distinct coexpression modules and cell types. Developmental analysis of macaque and human brains reveals shared and divergent spatiotemporal features and expression of neuropsychiatric risk genes. Another study shows how the transcriptomes of affected and neurotypical brains exhibit differences in gene regulatory networks and mRNA splicing, thus highlighting the importance of isoform-level regulation and cell type specificity in neuropsychiatric disorders. Because we examined a large number of individuals, quantitative trait loci (QTL) identification is improved, and QTLs are found to be associated with variation in cell type proportions in the brain, as well as those affecting chromatin, DNA hydroxymethylation, and gene expression. Additional investigations highlight the role of noncoding regions, particularly promotors, in ASD, as well as the three-dimensional structure of the genome and specific noncoding RNAs and transcription factors in schizophrenia. For these papers, the consortium developed analytical and biological tools. These include model systems for delineating regulatory networks: human induced pluripotent stem cell\textendash derived cerebral organoids and primary cultured olfactory neuroepithelial cells. Finally, all data and associated analysis products are available from the consortium website ([psychencode.org][2]). Overall, efforts such as the PsychENCODE project address how to link molecules, genes, and their regulatory elements to higher levels of biological complexity, from a single cell to human behavior. However, continued investigations are necessary, and the NIMH and the PsychENCODE Consortium envision future work that will provide additional insights into human brain origin, development, and function in health and disease. We dedicate this series of papers to Pamela Sklar, one of the chief architects and leaders of the PsychENCODE Consortium. Pamela's vision and ideas resonate throughout our studies.

This large study was able to characterize the details underlying many aspects of gene expression and provides a resource with which to better understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms of how genetic variants affect gene regulation and complex traits in humans.

Here, we present analyses of the version 8 data, examining 15,201 RNA-sequencing samples from 49 tissues of 838 postmortem donors. We comprehensively characterize genetic associations for gene expression and splicing in cis and trans, showing that regulatory associations are found for almost all genes, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and their contribution to allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy of complex traits. Leveraging the large diversity of tissues, we provide insights into the tissue specificity of genetic effects and show that cell type composition is a key factor in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in human tissues.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder whose pathophysiology is largely unknown. It has a heritability of 60-80\%, much of which is attributable to common risk alleles, suggesting genome-wide association studies can inform our understanding of aetiology. Here, in 69,369 people with schizophrenia and 236,642 controls, we report common variant associations at 270 distinct loci. Using fine-mapping and functional genomic data, we prioritise 19 genes based on protein-coding or UTR variation, and 130 genes in total as likely to explain these associations. Fine-mapped candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare disruptive coding variants in people with schizophrenia, including the glutamate receptor subunit GRIN2A and transcription factor SP4, and were also enriched for genes implicated by such variants in autism and developmental disorder. Associations were concentrated in genes expressed in CNS neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, but not other tissues or cell types, and implicated fundamental processes related to neuronal function, particularly synaptic organisation, differentiation and transmission. We identify biological processes of pathophysiological relevance to schizophrenia, show convergence of common and rare variant associations in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders, and provide a rich resource of priority genes and variants to advance mechanistic studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We characterize optic nerve photographs of 67,040 UK Biobank participants and use a multitrait genetic model to identify risk loci for glaucoma.

In the unselected glaucoma population, individuals in the top PRS decile reach an absolute risk for glaucoma 10 years earlier than the bottom decile and are at 15-fold increased risk of developing advanced glaucoma (top 10\% versus remaining 90\%, odds ratio\,=\,4.20). The PRS predicts glaucoma progression in prospectively monitored, early manifest glaucoma cases (P\,=\,0.004) and surgical intervention in advanced disease (P\,=\,3.6\,\texttimes\,10-6). This glaucoma PRS will facilitate the development of a personalized approach for earlier treatment of high-risk individuals, with less intensive monitoring and treatment being possible for lower-risk groups.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and it poses an ever-increasing burden to an aging population. Several loci responsible for the rare, autosomal dominant form of AD have been identified (APP, PS1 and PS2), and these have facilitated the development of the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD aetiology. The late onset form of the disease (LOAD) is poorly defined genetically, and up until recently the only known risk factor was the {$\epsilon$}4 allele of APOE. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common genetic variants that increase risk of LOAD. Two of the genes highlighted in these studies, CLU and CR1, suggest a role for the complement system in the aetiology of AD. In this review we analyse the evidence for an involvement of complement in AD. In particular we focus on one gene, CR1, and its role in the complement cascade. CR1 is a receptor for the complement fragments C3b and C4b and is expressed on many different cell types, particularly in the circulatory system. We look at the evidence for genetic polymorphisms in the gene and the possible physiological effects of these well-documented changes. Finally, we discuss the possible impact of CR1 genetic polymorphisms in relation to the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD and the way in which CR1 may lead to AD pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Recent genome-wide association studies identified the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE) as an Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk locus. However, the pathogenic mechanism by which ACE causes AD is unknown. Using whole-genome sequencing, we identified rare ACE coding variants in AD families and investigated one, ACE1 R1279Q, in knockin (KI) mice. Similar to AD, ACE1 was increased in neurons, but not microglia or astrocytes, of KI brains, which became elevated further with age. Angiotensin II (angII) and angII receptor AT1R signaling were also increased in KI brains. Autosomal dominant neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation occurred with aging in KI hippocampus, which were absent in the cortex and cerebellum. Female KI mice exhibited greater hippocampal electroencephalograph disruption and memory impairment compared to males. ACE variant effects were more pronounced in female KI mice, suggesting a mechanism for higher AD risk in women. Hippocampal neurodegeneration was completely rescued by treatment with brain-penetrant drugs that inhibit ACE1 and AT1R. Although ACE variant-induced neurodegeneration did not depend on {$\beta$}-amyloid (A{$\beta$}) pathology, amyloidosis in 5XFAD mice crossed to KI mice accelerated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, whereas A{$\beta$} deposition was unchanged. KI mice had normal blood pressure and cerebrovascular functions. Our findings strongly suggest that increased ACE1/angII signaling causes aging-dependent, A{$\beta$}-accelerated selective hippocampal neuron vulnerability and female susceptibility, hallmarks of AD that have hitherto been enigmatic. We conclude that repurposed brain-penetrant ACE inhibitors and AT1R blockers may protect against AD.},

Here we investigated its most similar relative, MPV17L2, which is also annotated as a mitochondrial protein. Mitochondrial fractionation analyses demonstrate MPV17L2 is an integral inner membrane protein, like MPV17. However, unlike MPV17, MPV17L2 is dependent on mitochondrial DNA, as it is absent from {$\rho$}(0) cells, and co-sediments on sucrose gradients with the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome and the monosome. Gene silencing of MPV17L2 results in marked decreases in the monosome and both subunits of the mitochondrial ribosome, leading to impaired protein synthesis in the mitochondria. Depletion of MPV17L2 also induces mitochondrial DNA aggregation. The DNA and ribosome phenotypes are linked, as in the absence of MPV17L2 proteins of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome are trapped in the enlarged nucleoids, in contrast to a component of the large subunit. These findings suggest MPV17L2 contributes to the biogenesis of the mitochondrial ribosome, uniting the two subunits to create the translationally competent monosome, and provide evidence that assembly of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome occurs at the nucleoid.},

We combine cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia, and UK Biobank (total N\,=\,300,486; age 16-102) and find 148 genome-wide significant independent loci (P\,{$<$}\,5\,\texttimes\,10-8) associated with general cognitive function. Within the novel genetic loci are variants associated with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, and brain structure. Gene-based analyses find 709 genes associated with general cognitive function. Expression levels across the cortex are associated with general cognitive function. Using polygenic scores, up to 4.3\% of variance in general cognitive function is predicted in independent samples. We detect significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function, reaction time, and many health variables including eyesight, hypertension, and longevity. In conclusion we identify novel genetic loci and pathways contributing to the heritability of general cognitive function.},

  abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests a role for autophagy dysregulation in Parkinson's disease (PD). The bulk degradation of cytoplasmic proteins (including {$\alpha$}-synuclein) and organelles (such as mitochondria) is mediated by macroautophagy, which involves the sequestration of cytosolic components into autophagosomes (AP) and its delivery to lysosomes. Accumulation of AP occurs in postmortem brain samples from PD patients, which has been widely attributed to an induction of autophagy. However, the cause and pathogenic significance of these changes remain unknown. Here we found in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of PD that AP accumulation and dopaminergic cell death are preceded by a marked decrease in the amount of lysosomes within dopaminergic neurons. Lysosomal depletion was secondary to the abnormal permeabilization of lysosomal membranes induced by increased mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species. Lysosomal permeabilization resulted in a defective clearance and subsequent accumulation of undegraded AP and contributed directly to neurodegeneration by the ectopic release of lysosomal proteases into the cytosol. Lysosomal breakdown and AP accumulation also occurred in PD brain samples, where Lewy bodies were strongly immunoreactive for AP markers. Induction of lysosomal biogenesis by genetic or pharmacological activation of lysosomal transcription factor EB restored lysosomal levels, increased AP clearance and attenuated 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced cell death. Similarly, the autophagy-enhancer compound rapamycin attenuated PD-related dopaminergic neurodegeneration, both in vitro and in vivo, by restoring lysosomal levels. Our results indicate that AP accumulation in PD results from defective lysosomal-mediated AP clearance secondary to lysosomal depletion. Restoration of lysosomal levels and function may thus represent a novel neuroprotective strategy in PD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The causes of intellectual disability remain largely unknown because of extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity. METHODS: We evaluated patients with intellectual disability to exclude known causes of the disorder. We then sequenced the coding regions of more than 21,000 genes obtained from 100 patients with an IQ below 50 and their unaffected parents. A data-analysis procedure was developed to identify and classify de novo, autosomal recessive, and X-linked mutations. In addition, we used high-throughput resequencing to confirm new candidate genes in 765 persons with intellectual disability (a confirmation series). All mutations were evaluated by molecular geneticists and clinicians in the context of the patients' clinical presentation. RESULTS: We identified 79 de novo mutations in 53 of 100 patients. A total of 10 de novo mutations and 3 X-linked (maternally inherited) mutations that had been previously predicted to compromise the function of known intellectual-disability genes were found in 13 patients. Potentially causative de novo mutations in novel candidate genes were detected in 22 patients. Additional de novo mutations in 3 of these candidate genes were identified in patients with similar phenotypes in the confirmation series, providing support for mutations in these genes as the cause of intellectual disability. We detected no causative autosomal recessive inherited mutations in the discovery series. Thus, the total diagnostic yield was 16\%, mostly involving de novo mutations. CONCLUSIONS: De novo mutations represent an important cause of intellectual disability; exome sequencing was used as an effective diagnostic strategy for their detection.

Deciphering their precise mode of action has proved challenging. SM proteins are thought to act primarily through one type of SNARE protein, the syntaxins. Despite high structural similarity, however, contrasting binding modes have been found for different SM proteins and syntaxins. Whereas the secretory SM protein Munc18 binds to the closed conformation" of syntaxin 1, the ER-Golgi SM protein Sly1 interacts only with the N-peptide of Sed5. Recent findings, however, indicate that SM proteins might interact simultaneously with both syntaxin regions. In search for a common mechanism, we now reinvestigated the Sly1/Sed5 interaction. We found that individual Sed5 adopts a tight closed conformation. Sly1 binds to both the closed conformation and the N-peptide of Sed5, suggesting that this is the original binding mode of SM proteins and syntaxins. In contrast to Munc18, however, Sly1 facilitates SNARE complex formation by loosening the closed conformation of Sed5.},

Associations are enriched in evolutionarily constrained genomic regions and loss-of-function intolerant genes and around brain-expressed regulatory marks.

  abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade, exemplified by antibodies targeting the PD-1 receptor, can induce durable tumor regressions in some patients. To enhance the efficacy of existing immunotherapies, we screened for small molecules capable of increasing the activity of T cells suppressed by PD-1. Here, we show that short-term exposure to small-molecule inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) significantly enhances T-cell activation, contributing to antitumor effects in vivo, due in part to the derepression of NFAT family proteins and their target genes, critical regulators of T-cell function. Although CDK4/6 inhibitors decrease T-cell proliferation, they increase tumor infiltration and activation of effector T cells. Moreover, CDK4/6 inhibition augments the response to PD-1 blockade in a novel ex vivo organotypic tumor spheroid culture system and in multiple in vivo murine syngeneic models, thereby providing a rationale for combining CDK4/6 inhibitors and immunotherapies.Significance: Our results define previously unrecognized immunomodulatory functions of CDK4/6 and suggest that combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade may increase treatment efficacy in patients. Furthermore, our study highlights the critical importance of identifying complementary strategies to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy for patients with cancer.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dementia is a major health concern for which prevention and treatment strategies remain elusive. Lowering high blood pressure with specific antihypertensive medications (AHMs) could reduce the burden of disease. We investigated whether specific AHM classes reduced the risk for dementia. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of individual participant data from eligible observational studies published between Jan 1, 1980, and Jan 1, 2019. Cohorts were eligible for inclusion if they prospectively recruited community-dwelling adults; included more than 2000 participants; collected data for dementia events over at least 5 years; had measured blood pressure and verified use of AHMs; included in-person exams, supplemented with additional data, to capture dementia events; and had followed up cases for mortality. We assessed the association of incident dementia and clinical Alzheimer's disease with use of five AHM classes, within strata of baseline high (systolic blood pressure [SBP] {$\geq$}140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] {$\geq$}90 mm Hg) and normal (SBP {$<$}140 mm Hg and DBP {$<$}90 mm Hg) blood pressure. We used a propensity score to control for confounding factors related to the probability of receiving AHM. Study-specific effect estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Six prospective community-based studies (n=31\hphantom{,}090 well phenotyped dementia-free adults older than 55 years) with median follow-ups across cohorts of 7-22 years were eligible for analysis. There were 3728 incident cases of dementia and 1741 incident Alzheimer's disease diagnoses. In the high blood pressure stratum (n=15\hphantom{,}537), those using any AHM had a reduced risk for developing dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}88, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}79-0{$\cdot$}98; p=0{$\cdot$}019) and Alzheimer's disease (HR 0{$\cdot$}84, 0{$\cdot$}73-0{$\cdot$}97; p=0{$\cdot$}021) compared with those not using AHM. We did not find any significant differences between one drug class versus all others on risk of dementia. In the normal blood pressure stratum (n=15 553), there was no association between AHM use and incident dementia or Alzheimer's disease. INTERPRETATION: Over a long period of observation, no evidence was found that a specific AHM drug class was more effective than others in lowering risk of dementia. Among people with hypertensive levels of blood pressure, use of any AHM with efficacy to lower blood pressure might reduce the risk for dementia. These findings suggest future clinical guidelines for hypertension management should also consider the beneficial effect of AHM on the risk for dementia.

  abstract = {Causal genes and variants within genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci can be identified by integrating GWAS statistics with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and determining which variants underlie both GWAS and eQTL signals. Most analyses, however, consider only the marginal eQTL signal, rather than dissect this signal into multiple conditionally independent signals for each gene. Here we show that analyzing conditional eQTL signatures, which could be important under specific cellular or temporal contexts, leads to improved fine mapping of GWAS associations. Using genotypes and gene expression levels from post-mortem human brain samples (n = 467) reported by the CommonMind Consortium (CMC), we find that conditional eQTL are widespread; 63\% of genes with primary eQTL also have conditional eQTL. In addition, genomic features associated with conditional eQTL are consistent with context-specific (e.g., tissue-, cell type-, or developmental time point-specific) regulation of gene expression. Integrating the 2014 Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia (SCZ) GWAS and CMC primary and conditional eQTL data reveals 40 loci with strong evidence for co-localization (posterior probability {$>$} 0.8), including six loci with co-localization of conditional eQTL. Our co-localization analyses support previously reported genes, identify novel genes associated with schizophrenia risk, and provide specific hypotheses for their functional follow-up.},

Conducting eQTL analyses for GTEx liver and skin samples using cell composition estimates as interaction terms, we identify thousands of genetic associations that are cell-type-associated. The skin cell-type associated eQTLs colocalize with skin diseases, indicating that variants which influence gene expression in distinct skin cell types play important roles in traits and disease. Our study provides a framework to estimate the cellular composition of GTEx tissues enabling the functional characterization of human genetic variation that impacts gene expression in cell-type-specific manners.},

Activation of complement leads to robust and efficient proteolytic cascades, which terminate in opsonization and lysis of the pathogen as well as in the generation of the classical inflammatory response through the production of potent proinflammatory molecules. More recently, however, the role of complement in the immune response has been expanded due to observations that link complement activation to adaptive immune responses. It is now appreciated that complement is a functional bridge between innate and adaptive immune responses that allows an integrated host defense to pathogenic challenges. As such, a study of its functions allows insight into the molecular underpinnings of host-pathogen interactions as well as the organization and orchestration of the host immune response. This review attempts to summarize the roles that complement plays in both innate and adaptive immune responses and the consequences of these interactions on host defense.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Degeneration of chronically demyelinated axons is a major cause of irreversible neurological disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Development of neuroprotective therapies will require elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which neurons and axons degenerate. METHODS: We report ultrastructural changes that support Ca2+-mediated destruction of chronically demyelinated axons in MS patients. We compared expression levels of 33,000 characterized genes in postmortem motor cortex from six control and six MS brains matched for age, sex, and postmortem interval. As reduced energy production is a major contributor to Ca2+-mediated axonal degeneration, we focused on changes in oxidative phosphorylation and inhibitory neurotransmission. RESULTS: Compared with controls, 488 transcripts were decreased and 67 were increased (p {$<$} 0.05, 1.5-fold) in the MS cortex. Twenty-six nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and the functional activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and III were decreased in the MS motor cortex. Reduced mitochondrial gene expression was specific for neurons. In addition, pre-synaptic and postsynaptic components of GABAergic neurotransmission and the density of inhibitory interneuron processes also were decreased in the MS cortex. INTERPRETATION: Our data supports a mechanism whereby reduced ATP production in demyelinated segments of upper motor neuron axons impacts ion homeostasis, induces Ca2+-mediated axonal degeneration, and contributes to progressive neurological disability in MS patients.},

  abstract = {The deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Normally, the accumulation of beta-amyloid is prevented in part by the activities of several degradative enzymes, including the endothelin-converting enzymes, neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme, and plasmin. Recent reports indicate that another metalloprotease, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), can degrade beta-amyloid in vitro and in cellular overexpression experiments. In addition, ACE gene variants are linked to AD risk in several populations. Angiotensin-converting enzyme, neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme function as vasopeptidases and are the targets of drugs designed to treat cardiovascular disorders, and ACE inhibitors are commonly prescribed. We investigated the potential physiological role of ACE in regulating endogenous brain beta-amyloid levels for two reasons: first, to determine whether beta-amyloid degradation might be the mechanism by which ACE is associated with AD, and second, to determine whether ACE inhibitor drugs might block beta-amyloid degradation in the brain and potentially increase the risk for AD. We analyzed beta-amyloid accumulation in brains from ACE-deficient mice and in mice treated with ACE inhibitors and found that ACE deficiency did not alter steady-state beta-amyloid concentration. In contrast, beta-amyloid levels are significantly elevated in endothelin-converting enzyme and neprilysin knock-out mice, and inhibitors of these enzymes cause a rapid increase in beta-amyloid concentration in the brain. The results of these studies do not support a physiological role for ACE in the degradation of beta-amyloid in the brain but confirm roles for endothelin-converting enzyme and neprilysin and indicate that reductions in these enzymes result in additive increases in brain amyloid beta-peptide levels.},

Using cell, biochemical and molecular-genetic protocols, we confirm it as the etiologic factor of this phenotype. Moreover, as an important functional confirmation, we rescued the normal molecular phenotype by expression of the wild-type TSFM cDNA in patient's fibroblasts. Different TSFM mutations can produce the same or very different clinical phenotypes, going from abortions to moderately severe presentations. On the other hand, the same TSFM mutation can also produce same or different phenotypes within the same range of presentations, therefore suggesting the involvement of unknown factors.},

  abstract = {For many complex traits, genetic variants have been found associated. However, it is still mostly unclear through which downstream mechanism these variants cause these phenotypes. Knowledge of these intermediate steps is crucial to understand pathogenesis, while also providing leads for potential pharmacological intervention. Here we relied upon natural human genetic variation to identify effects of these variants on trans-gene expression (expression quantitative trait locus mapping, eQTL) in whole peripheral blood from 1,469 unrelated individuals. We looked at 1,167 published trait- or disease-associated SNPs and observed trans-eQTL effects on 113 different genes, of which we replicated 46 in monocytes of 1,490 different individuals and 18 in a smaller dataset that comprised subcutaneous adipose, visceral adipose, liver tissue, and muscle tissue. HLA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were 10-fold enriched for trans-eQTLs: 48\% of the trans-acting SNPs map within the HLA, including ulcerative colitis susceptibility variants that affect plausible candidate genes AOAH and TRBV18 in trans. We identified 18 pairs of unlinked SNPs associated with the same phenotype and affecting expression of the same trans-gene (21 times more than expected, P{$<$}10-16). This was particularly pronounced for mean platelet volume (MPV): Two independent SNPs significantly affect the well-known blood coagulation genes GP9 and F13A1 but also C19orf33, SAMD14, VCL, and GNG11. Several of these SNPs have a substantially higher effect on the downstream trans-genes than on the eventual phenotypes, supporting the concept that the effects of these SNPs on expression seems to be much less multifactorial. Therefore, these trans-eQTLs could well represent some of the intermediate genes that connect genetic variants with their eventual complex phenotypic outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a complex disorder characterised by a broad range of clinical manifestations, differential pathological signatures, and genetic variability. Mutations in three genes-MAPT, GRN, and C9orf72--have been associated with FTD. We sought to identify novel genetic risk loci associated with the disorder. METHODS: We did a two-stage genome-wide association study on clinical FTD, analysing samples from 3526 patients with FTD and 9402 healthy controls. To reduce genetic heterogeneity, all participants were of European ancestry. In the discovery phase (samples from 2154 patients with FTD and 4308 controls), we did separate association analyses for each FTD subtype (behavioural variant FTD, semantic dementia, progressive non-fluent aphasia, and FTD overlapping with motor neuron disease [FTD-MND]), followed by a meta-analysis of the entire dataset. We carried forward replication of the novel suggestive loci in an independent sample series (samples from 1372 patients and 5094 controls) and then did joint phase and brain expression and methylation quantitative trait loci analyses for the associated (p{$<$}5 x 10(-8)) single-nucleotide polymorphisms. FINDINGS: We identified novel associations exceeding the genome-wide significance threshold (p{$<$}5 x 10(-8)). Combined (joint) analyses of discovery and replication phases showed genome-wide significant association at 6p21.3, HLA locus (immune system), for rs9268877 (p=1.05 x 10(-8); odds ratio=1.204 [95\% CI 1.11-1.30]), rs9268856 (p=5.51 x 10(-9); 0.809 [0.76-0.86]) and rs1980493 (p value=1.57 x 10(-8), 0.775 [0.69-0.86]) in the entire cohort. We also identified a potential novel locus at 11q14, encompassing RAB38/CTSC (the transcripts of which are related to lysosomal biology), for the behavioural FTD subtype for which joint analyses showed suggestive association for rs302668 (p=2.44 x 10(-7); 0.814 [0.71-0.92]). Analysis of expression and methylation quantitative trait loci data suggested that these loci might affect expression and methylation in cis. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that immune system processes (link to 6p21.3) and possibly lysosomal and autophagy pathways (link to 11q14) are potentially involved in FTD. Our findings need to be replicated to better define the association of the newly identified loci with disease and to shed light on the pathomechanisms contributing to FTD.

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a neuronal disease that affects up to 70 million people worldwide. The development of effective therapies to combat childhood epilepsy requires early biomarkers. Here, we performed a whole-genome microarray analysis in blood cells to identify genes differentially expressed between epileptic and epileptic valproic acid (VPA)-treated children versus normal children to obtain information about the gene expression to help us to understand genetic aspects of this disease. We found that the most significant differentially expressed genes were related to the transcriptional factor cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) that is overexpressed in children with epilepsy compared with normal children, and 6 and 12 months of VPA treatment reversed several of these changes. Interestingly, leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR1), a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that binds collagen proteins and contains CREB binding sites, was one of the more up-regulated genes in epileptic patients, and treatment with VPA strongly reversed its up-regulation. CREB up-regulates genes related to epilepsy; here, we suggest that LAIR1 could activate CREB, and together, they trigger epilepsy. After VPA treatment, LAIR1 repressed genes by disrupting the functional LAIR1(-)CREB complex, resulting in successful treatment. A functional microarray analysis offers new information that could open novel avenues of research in biomarker discovery, which may be useful for the early identification of children with a predisposition to epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is typically defined as a cognitive decline progressing to severe impairment in less than 1-2 years, typically within weeks or months. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is important because many conditions causing RPD are treatable. Neurosarcoidosis is often cited as an unusual reversible cause of RPD. METHODS: We report two cases of neurosarcoidosis presenting as RPD. RESULTS: Case 1: A 61-year-old woman developed a RPD associated with visual loss. In seven months she was dependent for self-care. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed temporal and suprasellar brain lesions. Treatment with high-dose intravenous prednisolone was associated with partial improvement. Case 2: A 43-year-old woman who was being treated for diabetes insipidus developed a severe episodic amnesia one year after onset of cognitive symptoms. Previous MRI had shown a hypothalamic lesion and she had been treated with oral prednisone and cyclophosphamide. There was reduction of the MRI findings but no improvement in the cognitive deficits. Brain biopsy disclosed noncaseous granulomas and granulomatous angiitis; treatment was changed to high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, with poor symptomatic response. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of RPD due to neurosarcoidosis can be challenging when the disease is restricted to the nervous system. In these cases, clinical presentation of RPD associated with neuroendocrine and visual dysfunction, imaging findings showing hypothalamic lesions and, in some cases, brain biopsy, are the key to a correct diagnosis. It is possible that earlier diagnoses and treatment could have led to a better outcome in these patients.},

  abstract = {Copy-number variation (CNV) is a major contributor to human genetic variation. Recently, CNV associations with human disease have been reported. Many genome-wide association (GWA) studies in complex diseases have been performed with sets of biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but the available CNV methods are still limited. We present a new method (TriTyper) that can infer genotypes in case-control data sets for deletion CNVs, or SNPs with an extra, untyped allele at a high-resolution single SNP level. By accounting for linkage disequilibrium (LD), as well as intensity data, calling accuracy is improved. Analysis of 3102 unrelated individuals with European descent, genotyped with Illumina Infinium BeadChips, resulted in the identification of 1880 SNPs with a common untyped allele, and these SNPs are in strong LD with neighboring biallelic SNPs. Simulations indicate our method has superior power to detect associations compared to biallelic SNPs that are in LD with these SNPs, yet without increasing type I errors, as shown in a GWA analysis in celiac disease. Genotypes for 1204 triallelic SNPs could be fully imputed, with only biallelic-genotype calls, permitting association analysis of these SNPs in many published data sets. We estimate that 682 of the 1655 unique loci reflect deletions; this is on average 99 deletions per individual, four times greater than those detected by other methods. Whereas the identified loci are strongly enriched for known deletions, 61\% have not been reported before. Genes overlapping with these loci more often have paralogs (p~=~0.006) and biologically interact with fewer genes than expected (p = 0.004).},

  abstract = {Deletions of chromosome 1p36 affect approximately 1 in 5,000 newborns and are associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and defects involving the brain, eye, ear, heart, and kidney. Arginine-glutamic acid dipeptide repeats (RERE) is located in the proximal 1p36 critical region. RERE is a widely-expressed nuclear receptor coregulator that positively regulates retinoic acid signaling. Animal models suggest that RERE deficiency might contribute to many of the structural and developmental birth defects and medical problems seen in individuals with 1p36 deletion syndrome, although human evidence supporting this role has been lacking. In this report, we describe ten individuals with intellectual disability, developmental delay, and/or autism spectrum disorder who carry rare and putatively damaging changes in RERE. In all cases in which both parental DNA samples were available, these changes were found to be de novo. Associated features that were recurrently seen in these individuals included hypotonia, seizures, behavioral problems, structural CNS anomalies, ophthalmologic anomalies, congenital heart defects, and genitourinary abnormalities. The spectrum of defects documented in these individuals is similar to that of a cohort of 31 individuals with isolated 1p36 deletions that include RERE and are recapitulated in RERE-deficient zebrafish and mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that mutations in RERE cause a genetic syndrome and that haploinsufficiency of RERE might be sufficient to cause many of the phenotypes associated with proximal 1p36 deletions.},

We therefore compared the cis-effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on gene expression between blood samples from 1,240 human subjects and four primary non-blood tissues (liver, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) from 85 subjects. We characterized four different mechanisms for 2,072 probes that show tissue-dependent genetic regulation between blood and non-blood tissues: on average 33.2\% only showed cis-regulation in non-blood tissues; 14.5\% of the eQTL probes were regulated by different, independent SNPs depending on the tissue of investigation. 47.9\% showed a different effect size although they were regulated by the same SNPs. Surprisingly, we observed that 4.4\% were regulated by the same SNP but with opposite allelic direction. We show here that SNPs that are located in transcriptional regulatory elements are enriched for tissue-dependent regulation, including SNPs at 3{${'}$} and 5{${'}$} untranslated regions (P = 1.84\texttimes 10-5 and 4.7\texttimes 10-4, respectively) and SNPs that are synonymous-coding (P = 9.9\texttimes 10-4). SNPs that are associated with complex traits more often exert a tissue-dependent effect on gene expression (P = 2.6\texttimes 10-10). Our study yields new insights into the genetic basis of tissue-dependent expression and suggests that complex trait associated genetic variants have even more complex regulatory effects than previously anticipated.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal {$\alpha$}-synuclein in selected regions of the brain following a gradient of severity with disease progression. Whether this is accompanied by globally altered protein synthesis is poorly documented. The present study was carried out in PD stages 1-6 of Braak and middle-aged (MA) individuals without alterations in brain in the substantia nigra, frontal cortex area 8, angular gyrus, precuneus and putamen. RESULTS: Reduced mRNA expression of nucleolar proteins nucleolin (NCL), nucleophosmin (NPM1), nucleoplasmin 3 (NPM3) and upstream binding transcription factor (UBF), decreased NPM1 but not NPM3 nucleolar protein immunostaining in remaining neurons; diminished 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA; reduced expression of several mRNAs encoding ribosomal protein (RP) subunits; and altered protein levels of initiation factor eIF3 and elongation factor eEF2 of protein synthesis was found in the substantia nigra in PD along with disease progression. Although many of these changes can be related to neuron loss in the substantia nigra, selective alteration of certain factors indicates variable degree of vulnerability of mRNAs, rRNAs and proteins in degenerating sustantia nigra. NPM1 mRNA and 18S rRNA was increased in the frontal cortex area 8 at stage 5-6; modifications were less marked and region-dependent in the angular gyrus and precuneus. Several RPs were abnormally regulated in the frontal cortex area 8 and precuneus, but only one RP in the angular gyrus, in PD. Altered levels of eIF3 and eIF1, and decrease eEF1A and eEF2 protein levels were observed in the frontal cortex in PD. No modifications were found in the putamen at any time of the study except transient modifications in 28S rRNA and only one RP mRNA at stages 5-6. These observations further indicate marked region-dependent and stage-dependent alterations in the cerebral cortex in PD. Altered solubility and {$\alpha$}-synuclein oligomer formation, assessed in total homogenate fractions blotted with anti-{$\alpha$}-synuclein oligomer-specific antibody, was demonstrated in the substantia nigra and frontal cortex, but not in the putamen, in PD. Dramatic increase in {$\alpha$}-synuclein oligomers was also seen in fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS)-isolated nuclei in the frontal cortex in PD. CONCLUSIONS: Altered machinery of protein synthesis is altered in the substantia nigra and cerebral cortex in PD being the frontal cortex area 8 more affected than the angular gyrus and precuneus; in contrast, pathways of protein synthesis are apparently preserved in the putamen. This is associated with the presence of {$\alpha$}-synuclein oligomeric species in total homogenates; substantia nigra and frontal cortex are enriched, albeit with different band patterns, in {$\alpha$}-synuclein oligomeric species, whereas {$\alpha$}-synuclein oligomers are not detected in the putamen.},

These cores are associated with the emergence of novel gene families in the hominoid lineage, but their genomic organization and gene characterization among other primates are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the genomic organization and expression of the core duplicon on chromosome 17 that led to the expansion of LRRC37 during primate evolution. A comparison of the LRRC37 gene family organization in human, orangutan, macaque, marmoset, and lemur genomes shows the presence of both orthologous and species-specific gene copies in all primate lineages. Expression profiling in mouse, macaque, and human tissues reveals that the ancestral expression of LRRC37 was restricted to the testis. In the hominid lineage, the pattern of LRRC37 became increasingly ubiquitous, with significantly higher levels of expression in the cerebellum and thymus, and showed a remarkable diversity of alternative splice forms. Transfection studies in HeLa cells indicate that the human FLAG-tagged recombinant LRRC37 protein is secreted after cleavage of a transmembrane precursor and its overexpression can induce filipodia formation.},

We present a set of integrated experiments that investigate the effects of common genetic variability on DNA methylation and mRNA expression in four human brain regions each from 150 individuals (600 samples total). We find an abundance of genetic cis regulation of mRNA expression and show for the first time abundant quantitative trait loci for DNA CpG methylation across the genome. We show peak enrichment for cis expression QTLs to be approximately 68,000 bp away from individual transcription start sites; however, the peak enrichment for cis CpG methylation QTLs is located much closer, only 45 bp from the CpG site in question. We observe that the largest magnitude quantitative trait loci occur across distinct brain tissues. Our analyses reveal that CpG methylation quantitative trait loci are more likely to occur for CpG sites outside of islands. Lastly, we show that while we can observe individual QTLs that appear to affect both the level of a transcript and a physically close CpG methylation site, these are quite rare. We believe these data, which we have made publicly available, will provide a critical step toward understanding the biological effects of genetic variation.},

  abstract = {Adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ with a role in many cardiometabolic diseases. It is comprised of a heterogeneous collection of cell types that can differentially impact disease phenotypes. Cellular heterogeneity can also confound -omic analyses but is rarely taken into account in analysis of solid-tissue transcriptomes. Here, we investigate cell-type heterogeneity in two population-level subcutaneous adipose-tissue RNA-seq datasets (TwinsUK, n = 766 and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project [GTEx], n = 326) by estimating the relative proportions of four distinct cell types (adipocytes, macrophages, CD4+ T~cells, and micro-vascular endothelial cells). We find significant cellular heterogeneity within and between the TwinsUK and GTEx adipose datasets. We find that adipose cell-type composition is heritable and confirm the positive association between adipose-resident macrophage proportion and obesity (high BMI), but we find a stronger BMI-independent association with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) derived body-fat distribution traits. We benchmark the impact of adipose-tissue cell composition on a range of standard analyses, including phenotype-gene expression association, co-expression networks, and cis-eQTL discovery. Our results indicate that it is critical to account for cell-type composition when combining adipose transcriptome datasets in co-expression analysis and in differential expression analysis with obesity-related traits. We applied gene expression by cell-type proportion interaction models (G \texttimes{} Cell) to identify 26 cell-type-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in 20 genes, including four autoimmune disease genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci. These results identify cell-specific eQTLs and demonstrate the potential of in silico deconvolution of bulk tissue to identify cell-type-restricted regulatory variants.},

  abstract = {Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) are fundamental drivers of the cell cycle and are required for the initiation and progression of various malignancies. Pharmacological inhibitors of CDK4/6 have shown significant activity against several solid tumours. Their primary mechanism of action is thought to be the inhibition of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest in tumour cells. Here we use mouse models of breast carcinoma and other solid tumours to show that selective CDK4/6 inhibitors not only induce tumour cell cycle arrest, but also promote anti-tumour immunity. We confirm this phenomenon through transcriptomic analysis of serial biopsies from a clinical trial of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment for breast cancer. The enhanced anti-tumour immune response has two underpinnings. First, CDK4/6 inhibitors activate tumour cell expression of endogenous retroviral elements, thus increasing intracellular levels of double-stranded RNA. This in turn stimulates production of type III interferons and hence enhances tumour antigen presentation. Second, CDK4/6 inhibitors markedly suppress the proliferation of regulatory T cells. Mechanistically, the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors both on tumour cells and on regulatory T cells are associated with reduced activity of the E2F target, DNA methyltransferase 1. Ultimately, these events promote cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance of tumour cells, which is further enhanced by the addition of immune checkpoint blockade. Our findings indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitors increase tumour immunogenicity and provide a rationale for new combination regimens comprising CDK4/6 inhibitors and immunotherapies as anti-cancer treatment.},

In this study we have analyzed three large samples of BP with imputed genome-wide association data and have performed a meta-analysis of 2196 cases with MICP and 8148 controls. We found several regions with suggestive evidence of association (P{$<$}10(-6)), although no marker met genome-wide significance criteria. The top associations were on chromosomes: 6q14.2 within the PRSS35/SNAP91 gene complex (rs1171113, P=9.67 \texttimes{} 10(-8)); 3p22.2 downstream of TRANK/LBA1 (rs9834970, P=9.71 \texttimes{} 10(-8)); and 14q24.2 in an intron of NUMB (rs2333194, P=7.03 \texttimes{} 10(-7)). These associations were present in all three samples, and both rs1171113 and rs2333194 were found to be overrepresented in an analysis of MICP cases compared with all other BP cases. To test the relationship of MICP with SZ, we performed polygenic analysis using the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium SZ results and found evidence of association between SZ polygenes and the presence of MICP in BP cases (meta-analysis P=0.003). In summary, our analysis of the MICP phenotype in BP has provided suggestive evidence for association of common variants in several genes expressed in the nervous system. The results of our polygenic analysis provides support for a modest degree of genetic overlap between BP with MICP and SZ, highlighting that phenotypic correlations across syndromes may be due to the influence of polygenic risk factors.},

Several genetic variants associated with schizophrenia have been identified, but the majority of the heritability remains unknown. In this study, we report on a case-control sample of Ashkenazi Jews (AJ), a founder population that may provide additional insights into genetic etiology of schizophrenia. We performed a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of 592 cases and 505 controls of AJ ancestry ascertained in the US. Subsequently, we performed a meta-analysis with an Israeli AJ sample of 913 cases and 1640 controls, followed by a meta-analysis and polygenic risk scoring using summary results from Psychiatric GWAS Consortium 2 schizophrenia study. The U.S. AJ sample showed strong evidence of polygenic inheritance (pseudo-R(2) {$\sim$}9.7\%) and a SNP-heritability estimate of 0.39 (P\,=\,0.00046). We found no genome-wide significant associations in the U.S. sample or in the combined US/Israeli AJ meta-analysis of 1505 cases and 2145 controls. The strongest AJ specific associations (P-values in 10(-6) -10(-7) range) were in the 22q 11.2 deletion region and included the genes TBX1, GLN1, and COMT. Supportive evidence (meta P\,{$<$}\,1\,\texttimes\,10(-4) ) was also found for several previously identified genome-wide significant findings, including the HLA region, CNTN4, IMMP2L, and GRIN2A. The meta-analysis of the U.S. sample with the PGC2 results provided initial genome-wide significant evidence for six new loci. Among the novel potential susceptibility genes is PEPD, a gene involved in proline metabolism, which is associated with a Mendelian disorder characterized by developmental delay and cognitive deficits.},

Leveraging GWAS results from three phenotypes with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major depression, and educational attainment), we identified seven additional loci shared with other traits at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture, we found both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity across ASD subtypes. These results highlight biological insights, particularly relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis, and establish that GWAS performed at scale will be much more productive in the near term in ASD.},

Here we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing to entorhinal cortex samples from control and Alzheimer's disease brains (n\,=\,6 per group), yielding a total of 13,214 high-quality nuclei. We detail cell-type-specific gene expression patterns, unveiling how transcriptional changes in specific cell subpopulations are associated with Alzheimer's disease. We report that the Alzheimer's disease risk gene APOE is specifically repressed in Alzheimer's disease oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and astrocyte subpopulations and upregulated in an Alzheimer's disease-specific microglial subopulation. Integrating transcription factor regulatory modules with Alzheimer's disease risk loci revealed drivers of cell-type-specific state transitions towards Alzheimer's disease. For example, transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal function, regulates multiple disease genes in a specific Alzheimer's disease astrocyte subpopulation. These results provide insights into the coordinated control of Alzheimer's disease risk genes and their cell-type-specific contribution to disease susceptibility.

  abstract = {A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) is a ubiquitous transmembrane metalloprotease that cleaves the extracellular regions from over 40 different transmembrane target proteins, including Notch and amyloid precursor protein. ADAM10 is essential for embryonic development and is also important in inflammation, cancer, and Alzheimer disease. However, ADAM10 regulation remains poorly understood. ADAM10 is compartmentalized into membrane microdomains formed by tetraspanins, which are a superfamily of 33 transmembrane proteins in humans that regulate clustering and trafficking of certain other transmembrane "partner" proteins. This is achieved by specific tetraspanin-partner interactions, but it is not clear which tetraspanins specifically interact with ADAM10. The aims of this study were to identify which tetraspanins interact with ADAM10 and how they regulate this metalloprotease. Co-immunoprecipitation identified specific ADAM10 interactions with Tspan5, Tspan10, Tspan14, Tspan15, Tspan17, and Tspan33/Penumbra. These are members of the largely unstudied TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, all six of which promoted ADAM10 maturation. Different cell types express distinct repertoires of TspanC8 tetraspanins. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells express relatively high levels of Tspan14, the knockdown of which reduced ADAM10 surface expression and activity. Mouse erythrocytes express predominantly Tspan33, and ADAM10 expression was substantially reduced in the absence of this tetraspanin. In contrast, ADAM10 expression was normal on Tspan33-deficient mouse platelets in which Tspan14 is the major TspanC8 tetraspanin. These results define TspanC8 tetraspanins as essential regulators of ADAM10 maturation and trafficking to the cell surface. This finding has therapeutic implications because focusing on specific TspanC8-ADAM10 complexes may allow cell type- and/or substrate-specific ADAM10 targeting.},

  abstract = {Lysine methylation is widespread on human proteins, however the enzymes that catalyze its addition remain largely unknown. This limits our capacity to study the function and regulation of this modification. Here we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knockout putative protein methyltransferases METTL21B and METTL23 in K562 cells, to determine if they methylate elongation factor eEF1A. The known eEF1A methyltransferase EEF1AKMT1 was also knocked out as a control. Targeted mass spectrometry revealed the loss of lysine 165 methylation upon knockout of METTL21B, and the expected loss of lysine 79 methylation on knockout of EEF1AKMT1 No loss of eEF1A methylation was seen in the METTL23 knockout. Recombinant METTL21B was shown in vitro to catalyze methylation on lysine 165 in eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, confirming it as the methyltransferase responsible for this methylation site. Proteomic analysis by SILAC revealed specific upregulation of large ribosomal subunit proteins in the METTL21B knockout, and changes to further processes related to eEF1A function in knockouts of both METTL21B and EEF1AKMT1 This indicates that the methylation of lysine 165 in human eEF1A has a very specific role. METTL21B exists only in vertebrates, with its target lysine showing similar evolutionary conservation. We suggest METTL21B be renamed eEF1A-KMT3. This is the first study to specifically generate CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts of putative protein methyltransferase genes, for substrate discovery and site mapping. Our approach should prove useful for the discovery of further novel methyltransferases, and more generally for the discovery of sites for other protein-modifying enzymes.},

Bioinformatics analyses prioritize candidate causal genes at 52 loci, including CD52, and demonstrate that asthma-associated variants are enriched in regions of open chromatin in immune cells. Lastly, we show that a murine anti-CD52 antibody mimics the immune cell-depleting effects of a clinically used human anti-CD52 antibody and reduces allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity in mice. These results further elucidate the genetic architecture of asthma and provide important insight into the immunological and sex-specific relevance of asthma-associated risk variants.},

Since the first public release of this annotation data set, few new protein-coding loci have been added, yet the number of alternative splicing transcripts annotated has steadily increased. The GENCODE 7 release contains 20,687 protein-coding and 9640 long noncoding RNA loci and has 33,977 coding transcripts not represented in UCSC genes and RefSeq. It also has the most comprehensive annotation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form consisting of two exons. We have examined the completeness of the transcript annotation and found that 35\% of transcriptional start sites are supported by CAGE clusters and 62\% of protein-coding genes have annotated polyA sites. Over one-third of GENCODE protein-coding genes are supported by peptide hits derived from mass spectrometry spectra submitted to Peptide Atlas. New models derived from the Illumina Body Map 2.0 RNA-seq data identify 3689 new loci not currently in GENCODE, of which 3127 consist of two exon models indicating that they are possibly unannotated long noncoding loci.

GBC and normal gallbladder tissues were extracted for the detection of mRNA and protein expressions of CLIC1. GBC-SD and NOZ cells in the logarithmic growth phase were selected to conduct the experiment. Three different siRNA recombined expression vectors were established using CLIC1 as a target at different sites. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting were, respectively, used to detect the CLIC1 mRNA and protein expressions. MTT assay was performed to detect the cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was applied to measure the cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. The variations of cell migration and invasion were evaluated using Transwell assay. GBC tissues showed higher CLIC1 mRNA and protein expressions than normal gallbladder tissues. The CLIC1 mRNA and protein expressions in the CLIC1 siRNA group were significantly lower than those in the NC and blank groups. Compared with the NC and blank groups, the CLIC1 siRNA group showed a significant decrease in cell proliferation but an obvious increase in apoptosis rate in GBC cells. Besides, in the CLIC1 siRNA group, cell percentage in G0/G1 and G2/M phase was gradually increased but decreased in S phases. The migration and invasion abilities in GBC cells were significantly lower than those in the NC and blank groups. Our study demonstrates that CLIC1 gene silencing could promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation migration and invasion of GBC cells.},

Previously, we and others have reported that ACE degrades in vitro the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), a putative upstream initiator of Alzheimer disease. These studies support the hypothesis that deficiency in ACE-mediated Abeta proteolysis could increase Alzheimer disease risk and raise the question of whether ACE inhibitors, a commonly prescribed class of anti-hypertensive medications, can elevate Abeta levels in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we administered the ACE inhibitor captopril to two lines of APP transgenic mice harboring either low levels of Abeta or high levels of Abeta with associated plaque deposition. In both models, we show that captopril does not affect cerebral Abeta levels in either soluble or insoluble pools. Furthermore, we find no change in plaque deposition or in peripheral Abeta levels. Data from these Alzheimer models suggest that captopril and similar ACE inhibitors do not cause Abeta accumulation in vivo.},

Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and nonneuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically-built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain.},

  abstract = {The highly complex structure of the human brain is strongly shaped by genetic influences. Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement, learning, memory and motivation, and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease. To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume and intracranial volume. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 x 10(-33); 0.52\% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport. Identification of these genetic variants provides insight into the causes of variability in human brain development, and may help to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric dysfunction.},

We identified 39 new loci among 75 genome-wide significant loci (P {$\leq$} 5 \texttimes{} 10-8), with most replicating in the combined International Consortium for Blood Pressure (ICBP; n = 69,396) and UK Biobank (UKB; n = 152,081) studies. Combining GERA with ICBP yielded 36 additional new loci, with most replicating in UKB. Combining all three studies (n = 321,262) yielded 241 additional genome-wide significant loci, although no replication sample was available for these. All associated loci explained 2.9\%, 2.5\%, and 3.1\% of variation in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure, respectively, in GERA non-Hispanic whites. Using multiple blood pressure measurements in GERA doubled the variance explained. A normalized risk score was associated with time to onset of hypertension (hazards ratio = 1.18, P = 8.2 \texttimes{} 10-45). Expression quantitative trait locus analysis of blood pressure loci showed enrichment in aorta and tibial artery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a clinically heterogeneous disease in which the risk of disease is influenced by complex genetic and environmental contributions. Alleles of HLA-DRB1, IRF5, and STAT4 are established susceptibility genes; there is strong evidence for the existence of additional risk loci. METHODS: We genotyped more than 500,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA samples from 1311 case subjects with SLE and 1783 control subjects; all subjects were North Americans of European descent. Genotypes from 1557 additional control subjects were obtained from public data repositories. We measured the association between the SNPs and SLE after applying strict quality-control filters to reduce technical artifacts and to correct for the presence of population stratification. Replication of the top loci was performed in 793 case subjects and 857 control subjects from Sweden. RESULTS: Genetic variation in the region upstream from the transcription initiation site of the gene encoding B lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK) and C8orf13 (chromosome 8p23.1) was associated with disease risk in both the U.S. and Swedish case-control series (rs13277113; odds ratio, 1.39; P=1x10(-10)) and also with altered levels of messenger RNA in B-cell lines. In addition, variants on chromosome 16p11.22, near the genes encoding integrin alpha M (ITGAM, or CD11b) and integrin alpha X (ITGAX), were associated with SLE in the combined sample (rs11574637; odds ratio, 1.33; P=3x10(-11)). CONCLUSIONS: We identified and then confirmed through replication two new genetic loci for SLE: a promoter-region allele associated with reduced expression of BLK and increased expression of C8orf13 and variants in the ITGAM-ITGAX region.},

  abstract = {Major depression is a debilitating psychiatric illness that is typically associated with low mood and anhedonia. Depression has a heritable component that has remained difficult to elucidate with current sample sizes due to the polygenic nature of the disorder. To maximize sample size, we meta-analyzed data on 807,553 individuals (246,363 cases and 561,190 controls) from the three largest genome-wide association studies of depression. We identified 102 independent variants, 269 genes, and 15 genesets associated with depression, including both genes and gene pathways associated with synaptic structure and neurotransmission. An enrichment analysis provided further evidence of the importance of prefrontal brain regions. In an independent replication sample of 1,306,354 individuals (414,055 cases and 892,299 controls), 87 of the 102 associated variants were significant after multiple testing correction. These findings advance our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of depression and provide several future avenues for understanding etiology and developing new treatment approaches.},

  abstract = {CD40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and, like other members, it appears to possess no intrinsic signaling capacity (e.g. kinase activity), suggesting that signal transduction is likely mediated by associating molecules. To identify such molecules, we have utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to clone cDNAs encoding proteins that bind the CD40 cytoplasmic domain. One such interacting protein, designated CD40-binding protein, has a N-terminal RING finger motif that is found in a number of DNA-binding proteins, including the V(D)J recombination activating gene RAG1. In addition, it contains a prominent central coiled-coil segment that may allow homo- or hetero-oligomerization. The C terminus possesses substantial homology to the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) domain that is found in two proteins (TRAF1 and TRAF2) that associate with the cytoplasmic domain of the related 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor. This is the first identification of a molecule that interacts with CD40 and whose sequence suggests a potential role in signaling.},

Little is currently known about the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in KSHV entry. We recently demonstrated that KSHV induces a plethora of host cell miRNAs during the early stages of infection. In this study, we show the ability of host cell novel miR-36 to specifically inhibit KSHV-induced expression of interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) to limit virus infection of cells. Transfecting cells with miR-36 mimic specifically lowered IFITM1 expression and thereby significantly dampening KSHV infection. In contrast, inhibition of miR-36 using miR-36 inhibitor had the direct opposite effect on KSHV infection of cells, allowing enhanced viral infection of cells. The effect of miR-36 on KSHV infection of cells was at a post-binding stage of virus entry. The highlight of this work was in deciphering a common theme in the ability of miR-36 to regulate infection of closely related DNA viruses: KSHV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and herpes simplexvirus-2 (HSV-2). Taken together, we report for the first time the ability of host cell miRNA to regulate internalization of KSHV, EBV, and HSV-2 in hematopoietic and endothelial cells.},

We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that involved 542,934 European participants and identified 336 novel genetic loci associated with refractive error. Collectively, all associated genetic variants explain 18.4\% of heritability and improve the accuracy of myopia prediction (area under the curve (AUC)\,=\,0.75). Our results suggest that refractive error is genetically heterogeneous, driven by genes that participate in the development of every anatomical component of the eye. In addition, our analyses suggest that genetic factors controlling circadian rhythm and pigmentation are also involved in the development of myopia and refractive error. These results may enable the prediction of refractive error and the development of personalized myopia prevention strategies in the future.},

We report a genome-wide mega-analysis involving 15,212 individuals with epilepsy and 29,677 controls, which reveals 16 genome-wide significant loci, of which 11 are novel. Using various prioritization criteria, we pinpoint the 21 most likely epilepsy genes at these loci, with the majority in genetic generalized epilepsies. These genes have diverse biological functions, including coding for ion-channel subunits, transcription factors and a vitamin-B6 metabolism enzyme. Converging evidence shows that the common variants associated with epilepsy play a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the brain. The results show an enrichment for monogenic epilepsy genes as well as known targets of antiepileptic drugs. Using SNP-based heritability analyses we disentangle both the unique and overlapping genetic basis to seven different epilepsy subtypes. Together, these findings provide leads for epilepsy therapies based on underlying pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis is a common disease of the central nervous system in which the interplay between inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes typically results in intermittent neurological disturbance followed by progressive accumulation of disability. Epidemiological studies have shown that genetic factors are primarily responsible for the substantially increased frequency of the disease seen in the relatives of affected individuals, and systematic attempts to identify linkage in multiplex families have confirmed that variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exerts the greatest individual effect on risk. Modestly powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled more than 20 additional risk loci to be identified and have shown that multiple variants exerting modest individual effects have a key role in disease susceptibility. Most of the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to the disease remains to be defined and is anticipated to require the analysis of sample sizes that are beyond the numbers currently available to individual research groups. In a collaborative GWAS involving 9,772 cases of European descent collected by 23 research groups working in 15 different countries, we have replicated almost all of the previously suggested associations and identified at least a further 29 novel susceptibility loci. Within the MHC we have refined the identity of the HLA-DRB1 risk alleles and confirmed that variation in the HLA-A gene underlies the independent protective effect attributable to the class I region. Immunologically relevant genes are significantly overrepresented among those mapping close to the identified loci and particularly implicate T-helper-cell differentiation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis has a clinically significant heritable component. We conducted a genomewide association study to identify alleles associated with the risk of multiple sclerosis. METHODS: We used DNA microarray technology to identify common DNA sequence variants in 931 family trios (consisting of an affected child and both parents) and tested them for association. For replication, we genotyped another 609 family trios, 2322 case subjects, and 789 control subjects and used genotyping data from two external control data sets. A joint analysis of data from 12,360 subjects was performed to estimate the overall significance and effect size of associations between alleles and the risk of multiple sclerosis. RESULTS: A transmission disequilibrium test of 334,923 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 931 family trios revealed 49 SNPs having an association with multiple sclerosis (P{$<$}1x10(-4)); of these SNPs, 38 were selected for the second-stage analysis. A comparison between the 931 case subjects from the family trios and 2431 control subjects identified an additional nonoverlapping 32 SNPs (P{$<$}0.001). An additional 40 SNPs with less stringent P values ({$<$}0.01) were also selected, for a total of 110 SNPs for the second-stage analysis. Of these SNPs, two within the interleukin-2 receptor alpha gene (IL2RA) were strongly associated with multiple sclerosis (P=2.96x10(-8)), as were a nonsynonymous SNP in the interleukin-7 receptor alpha gene (IL7RA) (P=2.94x10(-7)) and multiple SNPs in the HLA-DRA locus (P=8.94x10(-81)). CONCLUSIONS: Alleles of IL2RA and IL7RA and those in the HLA locus are identified as heritable risk factors for multiple sclerosis.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis is a complex autoimmune disease caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Translation of Genome-Wide Association Study findings into therapeutics and effective preventive strategies has been limited to date. We used summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to synthesize findings from public expression quantitative trait locus, methylation quantitative trait locus and Multiple Sclerosis Genome-Wide Association Study datasets. By correlating the effects of methylation on multiple sclerosis, methylation on expression and expression on multiple sclerosis susceptibility, we prioritize genetic loci with evidence of influencing multiple sclerosis susceptibility. We overlay these findings onto a list of 'druggable' genes, i.e. genes which are currently, or could theoretically, be targeted by therapeutic compounds. We use GeNets and search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins to identify protein-protein interactions and druggable pathways enriched in our results. We extend these findings to a model of Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cells, lymphoblastoid cell lines. We conducted a systematic review of prioritized genes using the Open Targets platform to identify completed and planned trials targeting prioritized genes in multiple sclerosis and related disease areas. Expression of 45 genes in peripheral blood was strongly associated with multiple sclerosis susceptibility (False discovery rate 0.05). Of these 45 genes, 20 encode a protein which is currently targeted by an existing therapeutic compound. These genes were enriched for Gene Ontology terms pertaining to immune system function and leucocyte signalling. We refined this prioritized gene list by restricting to loci where CpG site methylation was associated with multiple sclerosis susceptibility, with gene expression and where expression was associated with multiple sclerosis susceptibility. This approach yielded a list of 15 prioritized druggable target genes for which there was evidence of a pathway linking methylation, expression and multiple sclerosis. Five of these 15 genes are targeted by existing drugs and three were replicated in a smaller expression Quantitative Trait Loci dataset (CD40, MERTK and PARP1). In lymphoblastoid cell lines, this approach prioritized 7 druggable gene targets, of which only one was prioritized by the multi-omic approach in peripheral blood (FCRL3). Systematic review of Open Targets revealed multiple early-phase trials targeting 13/20 prioritized genes in disorders related to multiple sclerosis. We use public datasets and summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to identify a list of prioritized druggable genetic targets in multiple sclerosis. We hope our findings could be translated into a platform for developing targeted preventive therapies.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have identified 108 schizophrenia risk loci, but biological mechanisms for individual loci are largely unknown. Using developmental, genetic and illness-based RNA sequencing expression analysis in human brain, we characterized the human brain transcriptome around these loci and found enrichment for developmentally regulated genes with novel examples of shifting isoform usage across pre- and postnatal life. We found widespread expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), including many with transcript specificity and previously unannotated sequence that were independently replicated. We leveraged this general eQTL database to show that 48.1\% of risk variants for schizophrenia associate with nearby expression. We lastly found 237 genes significantly differentially expressed between patients and controls, which replicated in an independent dataset, implicated synaptic processes, and were strongly regulated in early development. These findings together offer genetics- and diagnosis-related targets for better modeling of schizophrenia risk. This resource is publicly available at http://eqtl.brainseq.org/phase1.},

  abstract = {Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. Methods We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68\hphantom{,}781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. Findings Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3{$\cdot$}9\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 3{$\cdot$}1\textendash 4{$\cdot$}6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7{$\cdot$}2\% (6{$\cdot$}0\textendash 8{$\cdot$}4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421\textendash 723) to 853 million (642\textendash 1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7{$\cdot$}9\% (6{$\cdot$}6\textendash 9{$\cdot$}2) for males and 6{$\cdot$}5\% (5{$\cdot$}4\textendash 7{$\cdot$}7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95\% UI 2782\textendash 3252] per 100\hphantom{,}000 in males vs s1400 [1279\textendash 1524] per 100\hphantom{,}000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082\textendash 3583] vs 2336 [2154\textendash 2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943\textendash 3630] vs 5643 [5057\textendash 6302]). Interpretation Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.

  abstract = {Insomnia is the second most prevalent mental disorder, with no sufficient treatment available. Despite substantial heritability, insight into the associated genes and neurobiological pathways remains limited. Here, we use a large genetic association sample (n\,=\,1,331,010) to detect novel loci and gain insight into the pathways, tissue and cell types involved in insomnia complaints. We identify 202 loci implicating 956 genes through positional, expression quantitative trait loci, and chromatin mapping. The meta-analysis explained 2.6\% of the variance. We show gene set enrichments for the axonal part of neurons, cortical and subcortical tissues, and specific cell types, including striatal, hypothalamic, and claustrum neurons. We found considerable genetic correlations with psychiatric traits and sleep duration, and modest correlations with other sleep-related traits. Mendelian randomization identified the causal effects of insomnia on depression, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and the protective effects of educational attainment and intracranial volume. Our findings highlight key brain areas and cell types implicated in insomnia, and provide new treatment targets.},

To extend our ability to annotate human disease processes, we have implemented a new drug class and have used it initially to annotate drugs relevant to cardiovascular disease. Our annotation model depends on external domain experts to identify new areas for annotation and to review new content. New web pages facilitate recruitment of community experts and allow those who have contributed to Reactome to identify their contributions and link them to their ORCID records. To improve visualization of our content, we have implemented a new tool to automatically lay out the components of individual reactions with multiple options for downloading the reaction diagrams and associated data, and a new display of our event hierarchy that will facilitate visual interpretation of pathway analysis results.},

This review focuses on recent data in the CYP24A1 field, including biochemical, physiological and clinical developments. Notable among these are: the first crystal structure for rat CYP24A1; mutagenesis studies which change the regioselectivity of the enzyme; and the finding that natural inactivating mutations of CYP24A1 cause the genetic disease idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH). The review also discusses the emerging correlation between rising serum phosphate/FGF-23 levels and increased CYP24A1 expression in chronic kidney disease, which in turn underlies accelerated degradation of both serum 25-OH-D(3) and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) in this condition. This review concludes by evaluating the potential clinical utility of blocking this enzyme with CYP24A1 inhibitors in various disease states.},

Using data from 85,760 individuals with activity-monitor derived measures of sleep timing we find that the chronotype loci associate with sleep timing: the mean sleep timing of the 5\% of individuals carrying the most morningness alleles is 25\,min earlier than the 5\% carrying the fewest. The loci are enriched for genes involved in circadian regulation, cAMP, glutamate and insulin signalling pathways, and those expressed in the retina, hindbrain, hypothalamus, and pituitary. Using Mendelian Randomisation, we show that being a morning person is causally associated with better mental health but does not affect BMI or risk of Type 2 diabetes.

Here we show that 4 of these TspanC8 (Tspan5, Tspan14, Tspan15 and Tspan33) which positively regulate ADAM10 surface expression levels differentially impact ADAM10-dependent Notch activation and the cleavage of several ADAM10 substrates, including APP, N-cadherin and CD44. Sucrose gradient fractionation, single molecule tracking and quantitative mass-spectrometry analysis of the repertoire of molecules co-immunoprecipitated with Tspan5, Tspan15 and ADAM10 show that these two tetraspanins differentially regulate ADAM10 membrane compartmentalization.

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www. genome.ad.jp/kegg/).},

It is an integrated database consisting of three generic categories of systems information, genomic information and chemical information, and an additional human-specific category of health information. KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules have been developed as generic molecular networks with KEGG Orthology nodes of functional orthologs so that KEGG pathway mapping and other procedures can be applied to any cellular organism. Unfortunately, however, this generic approach was inadequate for knowledge representation in the health information category, where variations of human genomes, especially disease-related variations, had to be considered. Thus, we have introduced a new approach where human gene variants are explicitly incorporated into what we call 'network variants' in the recently released KEGG NETWORK database. This allows accumulation of knowledge about disease-related perturbed molecular networks caused not only by gene variants, but also by viruses and other pathogens, environmental factors and drugs. We expect that KEGG NETWORK will become another reference knowledge base for the basic understanding of disease mechanisms and practical use in clinical sequencing and drug development.},

However, our understanding of the complexity and dynamics of the transcriptome of the human brain is incomplete. Here we report the generation and analysis of exon-level transcriptome and associated genotyping data, representing males and females of different ethnicities, from multiple brain regions and neocortical areas of developing and adult post-mortem human brains. We found that 86 per cent of the genes analysed were expressed, and that 90 per cent of these were differentially regulated at the whole-transcript or exon level across brain regions and/or time. The majority of these spatio-temporal differences were detected before birth, with subsequent increases in the similarity among regional transcriptomes. The transcriptome is organized into distinct co-expression networks, and shows sex-biased gene expression and exon usage. We also profiled trajectories of genes associated with neurobiological categories and diseases, and identified associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expression. This study provides a comprehensive data set on the human brain transcriptome and insights into the transcriptional foundations of human neurodevelopment.},

In a combined sample of over 1 million individuals, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of general risk tolerance, adventurousness, and risky behaviors in the driving, drinking, smoking, and sexual domains. Across all GWAS, we identified hundreds of associated loci, including 99 loci associated with general risk tolerance. We report evidence of substantial shared genetic influences across risk tolerance and the risky behaviors: 46 of the 99 general risk tolerance loci contain a lead SNP for at least one of our other GWAS, and general risk tolerance is genetically correlated ([Formula: see text]\,\textasciitilde\,0.25 to 0.50) with a range of risky behaviors. Bioinformatics analyses imply that genes near SNPs associated with general risk tolerance are highly expressed in brain tissues and point to a role for glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. We found no evidence of enrichment for genes previously hypothesized to relate to risk tolerance.},

PSA protected against tau-induced neurodegeneration in vivo, whereas PSA loss of function exacerbated neurodegeneration. We further show that human PSA directly proteolyzes tau in vitro. These data highlight the utility of using both evolutionarily distant species for genetic screening and functional assessment to identify modifiers of neurodegeneration. Further investigation is warranted in defining the role of PSA and other genes identified here as potential therapeutic targets in tauopathy.},

Using genome-wide association data from three studies (n = 8,816 that included 2,758 individuals from the Diabetes Genetics Initiative specific to the current paper as well as 1,874 individuals from the FUSION study of type 2 diabetes and 4,184 individuals from the SardiNIA study of aging-associated variables reported in a companion paper in this issue) and targeted replication association analyses in up to 18,554 independent participants, we show that common SNPs at 18 loci are reproducibly associated with concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and/or triglycerides. Six of these loci are new (P {$<$} 5 x 10(-8) for each new locus). Of the six newly identified chromosomal regions, two were associated with LDL cholesterol (1p13 near CELSR2, PSRC1 and SORT1 and 19p13 near CILP2 and PBX4), one with HDL cholesterol (1q42 in GALNT2) and five with triglycerides (7q11 near TBL2 and MLXIPL, 8q24 near TRIB1, 1q42 in GALNT2, 19p13 near CILP2 and PBX4 and 1p31 near ANGPTL3). At 1p13, the LDL-associated SNP was also strongly correlated with CELSR2, PSRC1, and SORT1 transcript levels in human liver, and a proxy for this SNP was recently shown to affect risk for coronary artery disease. Understanding the molecular, cellular and clinical consequences of the newly identified loci may inform therapy and clinical care.},

We conduct an extended genome-wide association study of genetic influences on 123 circulating metabolic traits quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics from up to 24,925 individuals and identify eight novel loci for amino acids, pyruvate and fatty acids. The LPA locus link with cardiovascular risk exemplifies how detailed metabolic profiling may inform underlying aetiology via extensive associations with very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride metabolism. Genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization uncover wide-spread causal effects of lipoprotein(a) on overall lipoprotein metabolism and we assess potential pleiotropic consequences of genetically elevated lipoprotein(a) on diverse morbidities via electronic health-care records.

Here, we introduce a method that leverages polygenic functional enrichment to incorporate coding, conserved, regulatory, and LD-related genomic annotations into association analyses. We show via simulations with real genotypes that the method, functionally informed novel discovery of risk loci (FINDOR), correctly controls the false-positive rate at null loci and attains a 9\%-38\% increase in the number of independent associations detected at causal loci, depending on trait polygenicity and sample size. We applied FINDOR to 27 independent complex traits and diseases from the interim UK Biobank release (average N = 130K). Averaged across traits, we attained a 13\% increase in genome-wide significant loci detected (including a 20\% increase for disease traits) compared to unweighted raw p values that do not use functional data. We replicated the additional loci in independent UK Biobank and non-UK Biobank data, yielding a highly statistically significant replication slope (0.66-0.69) in each case. Finally, we applied FINDOR to the full UK Biobank release (average N~= 416K), attaining smaller relative improvements (consistent with simulations) but larger absolute improvements, detecting an additional 583 GWAS loci. In conclusion, leveraging functional enrichment using our method robustly increases GWAS power.},

  abstract = {Regulation of protein synthesis makes a major contribution to post-transcriptional control pathways. During disease, or under stress, cells initiate processes to reprogramme protein synthesis and thus orchestrate the appropriate cellular response. Recent data show that the elongation stage of protein synthesis is a key regulatory node for translational control in health and disease. There is a complex set of factors that individually affect the overall rate of elongation and, for the most part, these influence either transfer RNA (tRNA)- and eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A)-dependent codon decoding, and/or elongation factor 2 (eEF2)-dependent ribosome translocation along the mRNA. Decoding speeds depend on the relative abundance of each tRNA, the cognate:near-cognate tRNA ratios and the degree of tRNA modification, whereas eEF2-dependent ribosome translocation is negatively regulated by phosphorylation on threonine-56 by eEF2 kinase. Additional factors that contribute to the control of the elongation rate include epigenetic modification of the mRNA, coding sequence variation and the expression of eIF5A, which stimulates peptide bond formation between proline residues. Importantly, dysregulation of elongation control is central to disease mechanisms in both tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration, making the individual key steps in this process attractive therapeutic targets. Here, we discuss the relative contribution of individual components of the translational apparatus (e.g. tRNAs, elongation factors and their modifiers) to the overall control of translation elongation and how their dysregulation contributes towards disease processes.},

The HPO's interoperability with other ontologies has enabled it to be used to improve diagnostic accuracy by incorporating model organism data. It also plays a key role in the popular Exomiser tool, which identifies potential disease-causing variants from whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing data. Since the HPO was first introduced in 2008, its users have become both more numerous and more diverse. To meet these emerging needs, the project has added new content, language translations, mappings and computational tooling, as well as integrations with external community data. The HPO continues to collaborate with clinical adopters to improve specific areas of the ontology and extend standardized disease descriptions.

To date we have identified fourteen mutations in Spike that are accumulating. Mutations are considered in a broader phylogenetic context, geographically, and over time, to provide an early warning system to reveal mutations that may confer selective advantages in transmission or resistance to interventions. Each one is evaluated for evidence of positive selection, and the implications of the mutation are explored through structural modeling. The mutation Spike D614G is of urgent concern; it began spreading in Europe in early February, and when introduced to new regions it rapidly becomes the dominant form. Also, we present evidence of recombination between locally circulating strains, indicative of multiple strain infections. These finding have important implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenesis and immune interventions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Genetic factors have been implicated in its etiology; however, the specific genes related to susceptibility to osteoporosis are not entirely known. To detect susceptibility genes for osteoporosis, we conducted a genome-wide association study in Japanese using {$\sim$}270,000 SNPs in 1,747 subjects (190 cases and 1,557 controls) followed by multiple levels of replication of the association using a total of {$\sim$}5,000 subjects (2,092 cases and 3,114 controls). Through these staged association studies followed by resequencing and linkage disequilibrium mapping, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs7605378 associated with osteoporosis. (combined P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.51\texttimes 10(-8), odds ratio{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.25). This SNP is in a previously unknown gene on chromosome 2q33.1, FONG. FONG is predicted to encode a 147 amino-acid protein with a formiminotransferase domain in its N-terminal (FTCD\_N domain) and is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues including bone. Our findings would give a new insight into osteoporosis etiology and pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Polymorphisms (single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)) in the interleukin-7 receptor-{$\alpha$} (IL-7R{$\alpha$})/IL-7 pathway are associated with an increased risk to develop multiple sclerosis (MS). The rs6897932 SNP in the IL-7R{$\alpha$} leads to increased soluble IL-7R{$\alpha$} production. Given the functional interaction between sIL-7R{$\alpha$}, membrane-bound IL-7R{$\alpha$} and IL-7, we assessed IL-7, mIL-7R{$\alpha$} and sIL-7R{$\alpha$} levels in MS patients and healthy controls (HCs). One-hundred and twenty eight MS patients had significantly lower sIL-7R{$\alpha$} levels compared with 73 HCs. The levels of sIL-7R{$\alpha$} increased dose-dependent upon rs6897932 [C] risk allele carriership in both HCs and MS. Next, we hypothesized that lower sIL-7R{$\alpha$} could result in a higher mIL-7R{$\alpha$} to soluble IL-7R{$\alpha$} ratio. Indeed, 52 MS patients had significantly increased mIL-7R{$\alpha$} to sIL-7R{$\alpha$} ratio for both CD4 and CD8 T cells compared with 44 HCs. Given the supposed role of IL-7 in autoimmunity, we determined whether sIL-7R{$\alpha$} influences IL-7 levels. IL-7 levels were significantly decreased in 40 MS patients compared with 40 HCs. In conclusion, MS patients had lower free IL-7 and a higher membrane to soluble IL-7R{$\alpha$} ratio. The soluble IL-7R{$\alpha$} levels correlate with the rs6897932 [C] risk allele carriership. The skew at the IL-7 and IL-7R{$\alpha$} level may influence responsiveness of IL-7R{$\alpha$}(+) cells.},

  abstract = {Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within and surrounding the complement receptor 1 (CR1) gene show some of the strongest genome-wide association signals with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Some studies have suggested that this association signal is due to a duplication allele (CR1-B) of a low copy repeat (LCR) within the CR1 gene, which increases the number of complement C3b/C4b-binding sites in the mature receptor. In this study, we develop a triplex paralogue ratio test assay for CR1 LCR copy number allowing large numbers of samples to be typed with a limited amount of DNA. We also develop a CR1-B allele-specific PCR based on the junction generated by an historical non-allelic homologous recombination event between CR1 LCRs. We use these methods to genotype CR1 and measure CR1-B allele frequency in both late-onset and early-onset cases and unaffected controls from the United Kingdom. Our data support an association of late-onset Alzheimer's disease with the CR1-B allele, and confirm that this allele occurs most frequently on the risk haplotype defined by SNV alleles. Furthermore, regression models incorporating CR1-B genotype provide a better fit to our data compared to incorporating the SNV-defined risk haplotype, supporting the CR1-B allele as the variant underlying the increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.},

Puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA/NPEPPS) is a novel modifier of TAU-induced neurodegeneration with neuroprotective effects via direct proteolysis of TAU protein. Here, to examine the effects of PSA/NPEPPS overexpression in vivo in the mammalian system, we generated and crossed BAC-PSA/NPEPPS transgenic mice with the TAU(P301L) mouse model of neurodegeneration. PSA/NPEPPS activity in the brain and peripheral tissues of human PSA/NPEPPS (hPSA) mice was elevated by {$\sim$}2-3-fold with no noticeable deleterious physiological effects. Double-transgenic animals for hPSA and TAU(P301L) transgenes demonstrated a distinct trend for delayed paralysis and showed significantly improved motor neuron counts, no gliosis and markedly reduced levels of total and hyperphosphorylated TAU in the spinal cord, brain stem, cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of adult and aged animals when compared with TAU(P301L) mice. Furthermore, endogenous TAU protein abundance in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells was significantly reduced or augmented by overexpression or knockdown of PSA/NPEPPS, respectively. This study demonstrated that without showing neurotoxic effects, elevation of PSA/NPEPPS activity in vivo effectively blocks accumulation of soluble hyperphosphorylated TAU protein and slows down the disease progression in the mammalian system. Our data suggest that increasing PSA/NPEPPS activity may be a feasible therapeutic approach to eliminate accumulation of unwanted toxic substrates such as TAU.},

  abstract = {The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype DRB1*15:01 is the major risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we find that DRB1*15:01 is hypomethylated and predominantly expressed in monocytes among carriers of DRB1*15:01. A differentially methylated region (DMR) encompassing HLA-DRB1 exon 2 is particularly affected and displays methylation-sensitive regulatory properties in vitro. Causal inference and Mendelian randomization provide evidence that HLA variants mediate risk for MS via changes in the HLA-DRB1 DMR that modify HLA-DRB1 expression. Meta-analysis of 14,259 cases and 171,347 controls confirms that these variants confer risk from DRB1*15:01 and also identifies a protective variant (rs9267649, p {$<$} 3.32 x 10(-8), odds ratio = 0.86) after conditioning for all MS-associated variants in the region. rs9267649 is associated with increased DNA methylation at the HLA-DRB1 DMR and reduced expression of HLA-DRB1, suggesting a modulation of the DRB1*15:01 effect. Our integrative approach provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of MS susceptibility and suggests putative therapeutic strategies targeting a methylation-mediated regulation of the major risk gene.},

  abstract = {Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and A{$\beta$} processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P\,=\,1.32\,\texttimes\,10(-7)), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.},

  abstract = {The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), the most common causative gene for autosomal-dominant familial Parkinson's disease, encodes a large protein kinase harboring multiple characteristic domains. LRRK2 phosphorylates a set of Rab GTPases in cells, which is enhanced by the Parkinson-associated LRRK2 mutations. Accumulating evidence suggests that LRRK2 regulates intracellular vesicle trafficking and organelle maintenance including Golgi, endosomes and lysosomes. Furthermore, genetic knockout or inhibition of LRRK2 cause lysosomal abnormalities in rodents and primates, and cells from Parkinson's patients with LRRK2 mutations also exhibit altered lysosome morphology. Cell biological studies on LRRK2 in a diverse cellular context further strengthen the potential connection between LRRK2 and regulation of the endolysosomal system, part of which is mediated by Rab phosphorylation by LRRK2. We will focus on the latest advances on the role of LRRK2 and Rab in relation to the endolysosomal system, and discuss the possible link to the pathomechanism of Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {RNA~sequencing (RNA-seq) is the leading technology for genome-wide transcript quantification. However, publicly available RNA-seq data is currently provided mostly in raw form, a significant barrier for global and integrative retrospective analyses. ARCHS4 is a web resource that makes the majority of published RNA-seq data from human and mouse available at the gene and transcript levels. For developing ARCHS4, available FASTQ files from RNA-seq experiments from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were aligned using a cloud-based infrastructure. In total 187,946 samples are accessible through ARCHS4 with 103,083 mouse and 84,863 human. Additionally, the ARCHS4 web interface provides intuitive exploration of the processed data through querying tools, interactive visualization, and gene pages that provide average expression across cell lines and tissues, top co-expressed genes for each gene, and predicted biological functions and protein\textendash protein interactions for each gene based on prior knowledge combined with co-expression.},

To identify other risk loci, we conducted a large genome-wide association study of 2,032 individuals from France with Alzheimer's disease (cases) and 5,328 controls. Markers outside APOE with suggestive evidence of association (P {$<$} 10(-5)) were examined in collections from Belgium, Finland, Italy and Spain totaling 3,978 Alzheimer's disease cases and 3,297 controls. Two loci gave replicated evidence of association: one within CLU (also called APOJ), encoding clusterin or apolipoprotein J, on chromosome 8 (rs11136000, OR = 0.86, 95\% CI 0.81-0.90, P = 7.5 x 10(-9) for combined data) and the other within CR1, encoding the complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1, on chromosome 1 (rs6656401, OR = 1.21, 95\% CI 1.14-1.29, P = 3.7 x 10(-9) for combined data). Previous biological studies support roles of CLU and CR1 in the clearance of beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide, the principal constituent of amyloid plaques, which are one of the major brain lesions of individuals with Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exome sequencing has led to the discovery of mutations in novel causative genes for epilepsy. One such gene is EEF1A2, encoding a neuromuscular specific translation elongation factor, which has been found to be mutated de novo in five cases of severe epilepsy. We now report on a further seven cases, each with a different mutation, of which five are newly described. METHODS: New cases were identified and sequenced through the Deciphering Developmental Disabilities project, via direct contact with neurologists or geneticists, or recruited via our website. RESULTS: All the mutations cause epilepsy and intellectual disability, but with a much wider range of severity than previously identified. All new cases share specific subtle facial dysmorphic features. Each mutation occurs at an evolutionarily highly conserved amino acid position indicating strong structural or functional selective pressure. CONCLUSIONS: EEF1A2 should be considered as a causative gene not only in cases of epileptic encephalopathy but also in children with less severe epilepsy and intellectual disability. The emergence of a possible discernible phenotype, a broad nasal bridge, tented upper lip, everted lower lip and downturned corners of the mouth may help in identifying patients with mutations in EEF1A2.},

  abstract = {Susceptibility to schizophrenia is inversely correlated with general cognitive ability at both the phenotypic and the genetic level. Paradoxically, a modest but consistent positive genetic correlation has been reported between schizophrenia and educational attainment, despite the strong positive genetic correlation between cognitive ability and educational attainment. Here we leverage published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in cognitive ability, education, and schizophrenia to parse biological mechanisms underlying these results. Association analysis based on subsets (ASSET), a pleiotropic meta-analytic technique, allowed jointly associated loci to be identified and characterized. Specifically, we identified subsets of variants associated in the expected ("concordant") direction across all three phenotypes (i.e., greater risk for schizophrenia, lower cognitive ability, and lower educational attainment); these were contrasted with variants that demonstrated the counterintuitive ("discordant") relationship between education and schizophrenia (i.e., greater risk for schizophrenia and higher educational attainment). ASSET analysis revealed 235 independent loci associated with cognitive ability, education, and/or schizophrenia at p {$<$} 5~\texttimes{} 10-8. Pleiotropic analysis successfully identified more than 100 loci that were not significant in the input GWASs. Many of these have been validated by larger, more recent single-phenotype GWASs. Leveraging the joint genetic correlations of cognitive ability, education, and schizophrenia, we were able to dissociate two distinct biological mechanisms-early neurodevelopmental pathways that characterize concordant allelic variation and adulthood synaptic pruning pathways-that were linked to the paradoxical positive genetic association between education and schizophrenia. Furthermore, genetic correlation analyses revealed that these mechanisms contribute not only to the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia but also to the broader biological dimensions implicated in both general health outcomes and psychiatric illness.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: African Americans, East Asians, and Hispanics with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) are more likely to develop lupus nephritis (LN) than are SLE patients of European descent. The etiology of this difference is not clear, and this study was undertaken to investigate how genetic variants might explain this effect. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 1244 SLE patients from multiethnic case collections were genotyped for 817,810 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. Continental genetic ancestry was estimated utilizing the program ADMIXTURE. Gene-based testing and pathway analysis was performed within each ethnic group and meta-analyzed across ethnicities. We also performed candidate SNP association tests with SNPs previously established as risk alleles for SLE, LN, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Association testing and logistic regression models were performed with LN as the outcome, adjusted for continental ancestries, sex, disease duration, and age. RESULTS: We studied 255 North European, 263 South European, 238 Hispanic, 224 African American and 264 East Asian SLE patients, of whom 606 had LN (48.7\%). In genome-wide gene-based and candidate SNP analyses, we found distinct genes, pathways and established risk SNPs associated with LN for each ethnic group. Gene-based analyses showed significant associations between variation in ZNF546 (p = 1.0E-06), TRIM15 (p = 1.0E-06), and TRIMI0 (p = 1.0E-06) and LN among South Europeans, and TTC34 (p = 8.0E-06) was significantly associated with LN among Hispanics. The SNP rs8091180 in NFATC1 was associated with LN (OR 1.43, p = 3.3E-04) in the candidate SNP meta-analysis with the highest OR among African-Americans (OR 2.17, p = 0.0035). CONCLUSION: Distinct genetic factors are associated with the risk of LN in SLE patients of different ethnicities. CKD risk alleles may play a role in the development of LN in addition to SLE-associated risk variants. These findings may further explain the clinical heterogeneity of LN risk and response to therapy observed between different ethnic groups.},

  abstract = {The role of epigenetic mechanisms in the function and homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS) and its regulation in diseases is one of the most interesting processes of contemporary neuroscience. In the last decade, a growing body of literature suggests that long-term changes in gene transcription associated with CNS's regulation and neurological disorders are mediated via modulation of chromatin structure. "Epigenetics", introduced for the first time by Waddington in the early 1940s, has been traditionally referred to a variety of mechanisms that allow heritable changes in gene expression even in the absence of DNA mutation. However, new definitions acknowledge that many of these mechanisms used to perpetuate epigenetic traits in dividing cells are used by neurons to control a variety of functions dependent on gene expression. Indeed, in the recent years these mechanisms have shown their importance in the maintenance of a healthy CNS. Moreover, environmental inputs that have shown effects in CNS diseases, such as nutrition, that can modulate the concentration of a variety of metabolites such as acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-coA), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) and beta hydroxybutyrate ({$\beta$}-HB), regulates some of these epigenetic modifications, linking in a precise way environment with gene expression. This manuscript will portray what is currently understood about the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the function and homeostasis of the CNS and their participation in a variety of neurological disorders. We will discuss how the machinery that controls these modifications plays an important role in processes involved in neurological disorders such as neurogenesis and cell growth. Moreover, we will discuss how environmental inputs modulate these modifications producing metabolic and physiological alterations that could exert beneficial effects on neurological diseases. Finally, we will highlight possible future directions in the field of epigenetics and neurological disorders.},

  abstract = {Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10\% of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16\% of phenotypic variation (approximately 20\% of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.},

Most cancers start due to changes at gene level that happen over a person's lifetime when DNA repair system becomes faulty. CCDC6, one of the players in DNA repair system acts as a tumor suppressor gene. It was originally identified in chimeric genes caused by chromosomal translocation involving RET proto-oncogene in some thyroid tumors. Different fusion chimers with different proto-oncogenes like RET are known for CCDC6 which hampered its function. Further, CCDC6 is recognized as a pro-apoptotic phosphoprotein, which is an ATM substrate responsive to genotoxic stress. In this article, we reviewed the published literature to characterize CCDC6 fusions with proto-oncogenes and the role of natural phytochemicals which can potentially alter CCDC6 activity and thus can prove beneficial for cancer patients.},

For the SNPs taken together, we found evidence of heterogeneous effects across environments. The SNPs implicate genes involved in brain-development processes and neuron-to-neuron communication. In a separate analysis of the X chromosome, we identify 10\,independent genome-wide-significant SNPs and estimate a SNP heritability of around 0.3\% in both men and women, consistent with partial dosage compensation. A joint (multi-phenotype) analysis of educational attainment and three related cognitive phenotypes generates polygenic scores that explain 11-13\% of the variance in educational attainment and 7-10\% of the variance in cognitive performance. This prediction accuracy substantially increases the utility of polygenic scores as tools in research.},

  abstract = {Chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) is a promising therapeutic target in cancer due to its intrinsic characteristics; it is overexpressed in specific tumor types and its localization changes from cytosolic to surface membrane depending on activities and cell cycle progression. Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical signaling molecules that modulate diverse cellular functions, including cell death. In this study, we investigated the function of CLIC1 in Ca2+ and ROS signaling in A549 human lung cancer cells. Depletion of CLIC1 via shRNAs in A549 cells increased DNA double-strand breaks both under control conditions and under treatment with the putative anticancer agent chelerythrine, accompanied by a concomitant increase in the p-JNK level. CLIC1 knockdown greatly increased basal ROS levels, an effect prevented by BAPTA-AM, an intracellular calcium chelator. Intracellular Ca2+ measurements clearly showed that CLIC1 knockdown significantly increased chelerythrine-induced Ca2+ signaling as well as the basal Ca2+ level in A549 cells compared to these levels in control cells. Suppression of extracellular Ca2+ restored the basal Ca2+ level in CLIC1-knockdown A549 cells relative to that in control cells, implying that CLIC1 regulates [Ca2+]i through Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. Consistent with this finding, the L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) blocker nifedipine reduced the basal Ca2+ level in CLIC1 knockdown cells to that in control cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CLIC1 knockdown induces an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ level via LTCC, which then triggers excessive ROS production and consequent JNK activation. Thus, CLIC1 is a key regulator of Ca2+ signaling in the control of cancer cell survival.},

Nclk has been suggested to play a regulatory role in neuro-cytoskeleton dynamics and in neuronal differentiation. In addition to the activation by Nck5a, Cdk5 is regulated by other mechanisms including additional activator proteins and inhibition by phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues. While Nclk shares common catalytic and regulatory properties with other members of the cdc2-like kinase family, it also displays unique characteristics that may be important for its neuronal functions.},

We obtained significant evidence of linkage throughout the whole data set (mlod=4.09; 59.9\% sharing). Surprisingly, similar sharing was also observed in 58 families in which both parents lacked the DRB1*15 allele (mlod=1.56; 62.7\% sharing; P=.0081). Our findings suggest that the notion that HLA-DRB1*15 is the sole major-histocompatibility-complex determinant of susceptibility in northern-European populations with MS may be incorrect. It remains possible that the association of MS with HLA-DRB1*15 is due to linkage disequilibrium with a nearby locus and/or to the presence of disease-influencing allele(s) in DRB1*15-negative haplotypes.},

  abstract = {C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive biomarker of chronic low-grade inflammation and is associated with multiple complex diseases. The genetic determinants of chronic inflammation remain largely unknown, and the causal role of CRP in several clinical outcomes is debated. We performed two genome-wide association studies (GWASs), on HapMap and 1000 Genomes imputed data, of circulating amounts of CRP by using data from 88 studies comprising 204,402 European individuals. Additionally, we performed in silico functional analyses and Mendelian randomization analyses with several clinical outcomes. The GWAS meta-analyses of CRP revealed 58 distinct genetic loci (p {$<$} 5~\texttimes{} 10-8). After adjustment for body mass index in the regression analysis, the associations at all except three loci remained. The lead variants at the distinct loci explained up to 7.0\% of the variance in circulating amounts of CRP. We identified 66 gene sets that were organized in two substantially correlated clusters, one mainly composed of immune pathways and the other characterized by metabolic pathways in the liver. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed a causal protective effect of CRP on schizophrenia and a risk-increasing effect on bipolar disorder. Our findings provide further insights into the biology of inflammation and could lead to interventions for treating inflammation and its clinical consequences.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify novel genes that are down-regulated in the testicular tissue of infertile men. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University-based reproductive clinics and genetics laboratory. PATIENTS: Nine patients with normal spermatogenesis, and 15 patients with maturation arrest (MA) or Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS). INTERVENTION: Testicular samples of patients with the same histology were pooled for complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Novel, down-regulated genes. RESULTS: In total, 300 genes were significantly down-regulated in SCOS or MA samples, and 10 novel sterility-related genes were identified. Of the 10 novel genes, 6 genes (Hs.126780, Hs.553658, Hs.274135, Hs.268122, Hs.531701, and Hs.171130) encode proteins with predictable functional domains, and all these functional domains are believed to correlate with spermatogenesis and/or spermiogenesis. Conversely, the other 4 genes (Hs.351582, Hs.407480, Hs.552781, and Hs.355570) do not encompass known functional domains. Two genes (Hs.407480 and Hs.552781) lack mouse orthologues. Most novel genes showed a testis-specific expression pattern in both mice and humans. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed three distinct types of developmental stage-dependent expressions of message ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for these novel genes in murine testes. CONCLUSION: These 10 novel genes provide targets to elucidate novel pathways involved in human spermatogenesis.},

Here, we perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) on 21 patients with prolactinomas to detect somatic mutations and then validate the mutations with digital polymerase~chain~reaction (PCR) analysis of tissue samples from 227 prolactinomas. We identify the same hotspot somatic mutation in splicing factor 3 subunit B1 (SF3B1R625H) in 19.8\% of~prolactinomas. These patients with mutant prolactinomas display higher prolactin (PRL) levels (p\,=\,0.02) and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p\,=\,0.02) compared to patients without the mutation. Moreover, we identify that the SF3B1R625H mutation causes aberrant splicing of estrogen related receptor gamma (ESRRG), which results in stronger binding of pituitary-specific positive transcription factor 1 (Pit-1), leading to excessive PRL secretion. Thus our study validates an important mutation and elucidates a potential mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of prolactinomas that may lead to the development of targeted therapeutics.},

They are heritable2,3 and etiologically related4,5 behaviors that have been resistant to gene discovery efforts6-11. In sample sizes up to 1.2\,million individuals, we discovered 566 genetic variants in 406 loci associated with multiple stages of tobacco use (initiation, cessation, and heaviness) as well as alcohol use, with 150 loci evidencing pleiotropic association. Smoking phenotypes were positively genetically correlated with many health conditions, whereas alcohol use was negatively correlated with these conditions, such that increased genetic risk for alcohol use is associated with lower disease risk. We report evidence for the involvement of many systems in tobacco and alcohol use, including genes involved in nicotinic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission. The results provide a solid starting point to evaluate the effects of these loci in model organisms and more precise substance use measures.},

  abstract = {Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a strategy used worldwide for managing hypertension. In addition to converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, ACE also converts neurotoxic {$\beta$}-amyloid protein 42 (A{$\beta$}42) to A{$\beta$}40. Because of its neurotoxicity, A{$\beta$}42 is believed to play a causative role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas A{$\beta$}40 has neuroprotective effects against A{$\beta$}42 aggregation and also against metal-induced oxidative damage. Whether ACE inhibition enhances A{$\beta$}42 aggregation or impairs human cognitive ability are very important issues for preventing AD onset and for optimal hypertension management. In an 8-year longitudinal study, we found here that the mean intelligence quotient of male, but not female, hypertensive patients taking ACE inhibitors declined more rapidly than that of others taking no ACE inhibitors. Moreover, the sera of all AD patients exhibited a decrease in A{$\beta$}42-to-A{$\beta$}40-converting activity compared with sera from age-matched healthy individuals. Using human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice, we found that a clinical dose of an ACE inhibitor was sufficient to increase brain amyloid deposition. We also generated human amyloid precursor protein/ACE(+/-) mice and found that a decrease in ACE levels promoted A{$\beta$}42 deposition and increased the number of apoptotic neurons. These results suggest that inhibition of ACE activity is a risk factor for impaired human cognition and for triggering AD onset.},

  abstract = {Obesity is heritable and predisposes to many diseases. To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P~{$<~$}5~\texttimes ~10(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for {$\sim$}2.7\% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for {$>$}20\% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.},

Yet despite their widespread utility, no common storage format has been widely adopted, hindering tool development and data sharing, analysis and integration. Existing tabular formats \textsuperscript{7,8} often ambiguously or incompletely store information about genetic variants and their associations, and also lack essential metadata increasing the possibility of errors in data interpretation and post-GWAS analyses. Additionally, data in these formats are typically not indexed, requiring the whole file to be read which is computationally inefficient. To address these issues, we propose an adaptation of the variant call format\textsuperscript{9} (GWAS-VCF) and have produced a suite of open-source tools for using this format in downstream analyses. Simulation studies determine GWAS-VCF is 9-46x faster than tabular alternatives when extracting variant(s) by genomic position. Our results demonstrate the GWAS-VCF provides a robust and performant solution for sharing, analysis and integration of GWAS data.

  abstract = {The prevalence of severe obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) {$\geq$} 35.0 kg/m(2), is rising rapidly. Given the disproportionately high health burden and healthcare costs associated with this condition, understanding the underlying aetiology, including predisposing genetic factors, is a biomedical research priority. Previous studies have suggested that severe obesity represents an extreme tail of the population BMI variation, reflecting shared genetic factors operating across the spectrum. Here, we sought to determine whether a panel of 32 known common obesity-susceptibility variants contribute to severe obesity in patients (n = 1,003, mean BMI 48.4 {$\pm$} 8.1 kg/m(2)) attending bariatric surgery clinics in two European centres. We examined the effects of these 32 common variants on obesity risk and BMI, both as individual markers and in combination as a genetic risk score, in a comparison with normal-weight controls (n = 1,809, BMI 18.0-24.9 kg/m(2)); an approach which, to our knowledge, has not been previously undertaken in the setting of a bariatric clinic. We found strong associations with severe obesity for SNP rs9939609 within the FTO gene (P = 9.3 \texttimes{} 10(-8)) and SNP rs2815752 near the NEGR1 gene (P = 3.6 \texttimes{} 10(-4)), and directionally consistent nominal associations (P{$<$}0.05) for 12 other SNPs. The genetic risk score associated with severe obesity (P = 8.3 \texttimes{} 10(-11)) but, within the bariatric cohort, this score did not associate with BMI itself (P = 0.264). Our results show significant effects of individual BMI-associated common variants within a relatively small sample size of bariatric patients. Furthermore, the burden of such low-penetrant risk alleles contributes to severe obesity in this population. Our findings support that severe obesity observed in bariatric patients represents an extreme tail of the population BMI variation. Moreover, future genetic studies focused on bariatric patients may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of obesity at a population level.},

Previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of C3 by overexpression of soluble complement receptor-related protein y in an AD mouse model led to reduced microgliosis, increased amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque burden, and neurodegeneration. To further address the role of C3 in AD pathology, we generated a complement C3-deficient amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic AD mouse model (APP;C3(-/-)). Brains were analyzed at 8, 12, and 17 months of age by immunohistochemical and biochemical methods and compared with age-matched APP transgenic mice. At younger ages (8-12 months), no significant neuropathological differences were observed between the two transgenic lines. In contrast, at 17 months of age, APP;C3(-/-) mice showed significant changes of up to twofold increased total Abeta and fibrillar amyloid plaque burden in midfrontal cortex and hippocampus, which correlated with (1) significantly increased Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-insoluble Abeta(42) levels and reduced TBS-soluble Abeta(42) and Abeta(40) levels in brain homogenates, (2) a trend for increased Abeta levels in the plasma, (3) a significant loss of neuronal-specific nuclear protein-positive neurons in the hippocampus, and (4) differential activation of microglia toward a more alternative phenotype (e.g., significantly increased CD45-positive microglia, increased brain levels of interleukins 4 and 10, and reduced levels of CD68, F4/80, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and tumor necrosis factor). Our results suggest a beneficial role for complement C3 in plaque clearance and neuronal health as well as in modulation of the microglia phenotype.},

However, the functional significance of eEF1A methylation remains obscure and it has remained unclear whether eEF1A methylation is dynamic and subject to active regulation. We here demonstrate, using a wide range of in vitro and in vivo approaches, that the previously uncharacterized human methyltransferase METTL21B specifically targets Lys-165 in eEF1A in an aminoacyl-tRNA- and GTP-dependent manner. Interestingly, METTL21B-mediated eEF1A methylation showed strong variation across different tissues and cell lines, and was induced by altering growth conditions or by treatment with certain ER-stress-inducing drugs, concomitant with an increase in METTL21B gene expression. Moreover, genetic ablation of METTL21B function in mammalian cells caused substantial alterations in mRNA translation, as measured by ribosomal profiling. A non-canonical function for eEF1A in organization of the cellular cytoskeleton has been reported, and interestingly, METTL21B accumulated in centrosomes, in addition to the expected cytosolic localization. In summary, the present study identifies METTL21B as the enzyme responsible for methylation of eEF1A on Lys-165 and shows that this modification is dynamic, inducible and likely of regulatory importance.},

This study was conducted to estimate the role of talin-1 and midkine in combination with total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as tumor markers in HCC patients. Methods: Serum levels of talin-1 and midkine were measured in 90 Egyptian subjects including 44 patients with HCC, 31patients with cirrhosis and 15 healthy controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. While a colorimetric method was used for measurement of TAC. Results: Serum talin-1 in HCC patients was significantly lower than that in patients with cirrhosis (P{$<$}0.001) and normal control (P{$<$}0.001). In addition, increased invasion and metastasis correlated with reduced talin-1 level. Serum midkine in HCC patients was significantly higher compared to cirrhotic patients (P{$<$}0.001) and normal control (P{$<$}0.001). Midkine at a cut off value of 1683 pg/ml showed a sensitivity of (81.82\%) and specificity of (83.87\%). While alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) at a cut off value of 200 ng/ml had a sensitivity of (52.27\%), while specificity was (96.77\%). Midkine was positive in 80.9\% of HCC patients with negative AFP. Serum TAC was significantly decreased in HCC patients when compared with control group (P{$<$}0.001). Conclusion: Talin-1 may be implicated in the carcinogenesis and metastasis of HCC and can be used as a useful tumor marker for HCC. Midkine may be a potential diagnostic marker for HCC and may be used in addition to AFP to increase the sensitivity of HCC detection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies provided many biological insights into coronary artery disease (CAD), but these studies were mainly performed in Europeans. Genome-wide association studies in diverse populations have the potential to advance our understanding of CAD. METHODS: We conducted 2 genome-wide association studies for CAD in the Japanese population, which included 12 494 cases and 28 879 controls and 2808 cases and 7261 controls, respectively. Then, we performed transethnic meta-analysis using the results of the coronary artery disease genome-wide replication and meta-analysis plus the coronary artery disease 1000 Genomes meta-analysis with UK Biobank. We then explored the pathophysiological significance of these novel loci and examined the differences in CAD-susceptibility loci between Japanese and Europeans. RESULTS: We identified 3 new loci on chromosome 1q21 (CTSS), 10q26 (WDR11-FGFR2), and 11q22 (RDX-FDX1). Quantitative trait locus analyses suggested the association of CTSS and RDX-FDX1 with atherosclerotic immune cells. Tissue/cell type enrichment analysis showed the involvement of arteries, adrenal glands, and fat tissues in the development of CAD. We next compared the odds ratios of lead variants for myocardial infarction at 76 genome-wide significant loci in the transethnic meta-analysis and a moderate correlation between Japanese and Europeans, where 8 loci showed a difference. Finally, we performed tissue/cell type enrichment analysis using East Asian-frequent and European-frequent variants according to the risk allele frequencies and identified significant enrichment of adrenal glands in the East Asian-frequent group while the enrichment of arteries and fat tissues was found in the European-frequent group. These findings indicate biological differences in CAD susceptibility between Japanese and Europeans. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 3 new loci for CAD and highlighted the genetic differences between the Japanese and European populations. Moreover, our transethnic analyses showed both shared and unique genetic architectures between the Japanese and Europeans. While most of the underlying genetic bases for CAD are shared, further analyses in diverse populations will be needed to elucidate variations fully.},

  abstract = {A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) is a ubiquitous transmembrane protein that functions as a "molecular scissor" to cleave the extracellular regions from its transmembrane target proteins. ADAM10 is well characterized as the ligand-dependent activator of Notch proteins, which control cell fate decisions. Indeed, conditional knockouts of ADAM10 in mice reveal impaired B-, T-, and myeloid cell development and/or function. ADAM10 cleaves many other leukocyte-expressed substrates. On B-cells, ADAM10 cleavage of the low-affinity IgE receptor CD23 promotes allergy and asthma, cleavage of ICOS ligand impairs antibody responses, and cleavage of the BAFF-APRIL receptor transmembrane activator and CAML interactor, and BAFF receptor, reduce B-cell survival. On microglia, increased ADAM10 cleavage of a rare variant of the scavenger receptor triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 may increase susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease. We and others recently showed that ADAM10 interacts with one of six different regulatory tetraspanin membrane proteins, which we termed the TspanC8 subgroup, comprising Tspan5, Tspan10, Tspan14, Tspan15, Tspan17, and Tspan33. The TspanC8s are required for ADAM10 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, and emerging evidence suggests that they dictate ADAM10 subcellular localization and substrate specificity. Therefore, we propose that ADAM10 should not be regarded as a single scissor, but as six different scissors with distinct substrate specificities, depending on the associated TspanC8. In this review, we collate recent transcriptomic data to present the TspanC8 repertoires of leukocytes, and we discuss the potential role of the six TspanC8/ADAM10 scissors in leukocyte development and function.},

  abstract = {Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, are normally quiescent but become activated after infection or injury. Their properties then change, and they promote both repair and damage processes. The extent of microglial activation is regulated, in part, by activation-induced cell death (AICD). Although many apoptotic aspects of the microglial AICD mechanism have been elucidated, little is known about the connection between the activation step and the death process. Using mouse primary microglial cultures, we show that the ectoenzyme CD38, via its calcium-mobilizing metabolite cyclic-ADP-ribose (cADPR), helps promote microglial activation and AICD induced by LPS plus IFN-gamma (LPS/IFN-gamma), suggesting that CD38 links the two processes. Accordingly, CD38 expression and activity, as well as the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the primary microglia were increased by LPS/IFN-gamma treatment. Moreover, CD38 deficiency or treatment with cADPR antagonists conferred partial resistance to LPS/IFN-gamma-induced AICD and also reduced [Ca2+]i. Microglial activation, indicated by induced expression of NO synthase-2 mRNA and production of NO, secretion and mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and IL-12 p40, and expression of IL-6 mRNA, was attenuated by CD38 deficiency or cADPR-antagonist treatment. The observed effects of CD38 on microglial activation are probably mediated via a cADPR-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i and the effect on AICD by regulation of NO production. Our results thus suggest that CD38 significantly affects regulation of the amount and function of activated microglia, with important consequences for injury and repair processes in the brain.},

However, the massive data sets generated by NGS\textemdash the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases\textemdash make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D may have a protective role in the etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS), but the effect of gestational vitamin D on adult onset MS has not been studied. METHODS: In 2001, 35,794 mothers of participants of the Nurses' Health Study II completed a questionnaire inquiring about their experiences and diet during pregnancy with their nurse daughters. We studied the association of maternal milk intake, maternal dietary vitamin D intake, and predicted maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) during pregnancy and their daughters' risk of developing MS. RESULTS: MS was diagnosed in 199 women. The relative risk of MS was lower among women born to mothers with high milk or vitamin D intake during pregnancy. The multivariate adjusted rate ratio (RR) of MS was 0.62 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.95; p trend = 0.001) for nurses whose mothers consumed 2 to 3 glasses of milk per day compared with those whose mothers consumed {$<$}3 glasses per month, and 0.57 (95\% CI, 0.35-0.91; p trend = 0.002) for nurses with mothers in the highest quintile of dietary vitamin D intake compared with those in the lowest. The predicted 25(OH)D level in the pregnant mothers was also inversely associated with the risk of MS in their daughters. Comparing extreme quintiles, the adjusted RR was 0.59; (95\% CI, 0.37-0.92; p trend = 0.002). INTERPRETATION: Higher maternal milk and vitamin D intake during pregnancy may be associated with a lower risk of developing MS in offspring.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies have demonstrated an association between decreased vitamin D level and risk of multiple sclerosis (MS); however, it remains unclear whether this relationship is causal. We undertook a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate whether genetically lowered vitamin D level influences the risk of MS. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level from SUNLIGHT, the largest (n = 33,996) genome-wide association study to date for vitamin D. Four SNPs were genome-wide significant for 25OHD level (p-values ranging from 6 \texttimes{} 10-10 to 2 \texttimes{} 10-109), and all four SNPs lay in, or near, genes strongly implicated in separate mechanisms influencing 25OHD. We then ascertained their effect on 25OHD level in 2,347 participants from a population-based cohort, the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study, and tested the extent to which the 25OHD-decreasing alleles explained variation in 25OHD level. We found that the count of 25OHD-decreasing alleles across these four SNPs was strongly associated with lower 25OHD level (n = 2,347, F-test statistic = 49.7, p = 2.4 \texttimes{} 10-12). Next, we conducted an MR study to describe the effect of genetically lowered 25OHD on the odds of MS in the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium study, the largest genetic association study to date for MS (including up to 14,498 cases and 24,091 healthy controls). Alleles were weighted by their relative effect on 25OHD level, and sensitivity analyses were performed to test MR assumptions. MR analyses found that each genetically determined one-standard-deviation decrease in log-transformed 25OHD level conferred a 2.0-fold increase in the odds of MS (95\% CI: 1.7-2.5; p = 7.7 \texttimes{} 10-12; I2 = 63\%, 95\% CI: 0\%-88\%). This result persisted in sensitivity analyses excluding SNPs possibly influenced by population stratification or pleiotropy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, 95\% CI: 1.3-2.2; p = 2.3 \texttimes{} 10-5; I2 = 47\%, 95\% CI: 0\%-85\%) and including only SNPs involved in 25OHD synthesis or metabolism (ORsynthesis = 2.1, 95\% CI: 1.6-2.6, p = 1 \texttimes{} 10-9; ORmetabolism = 1.9, 95\% CI: 1.3-2.7, p = 0.002). While these sensitivity analyses decreased the possibility that pleiotropy may have biased the results, residual pleiotropy is difficult to exclude entirely. CONCLUSIONS: A genetically lowered 25OHD level is strongly associated with increased susceptibility to MS. Whether vitamin D sufficiency can delay, or prevent, MS onset merits further investigation in long-term randomized controlled trials.},

We confirm these associations in two independent AD datasets. We also illustrate the use of the network in prioritizing amyloid- and cognition-associated genes for in vitro validation in human neurons and astrocytes. These analyses based on unique cohorts enable us to resolve the role of distinct cortical modules that have a direct effect on the accumulation of AD pathology from those that have a direct effect on cognitive decline, exemplifying a network approach to complex diseases.},

  abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common and highly heritable mental illness and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have robustly identified the first common genetic variants involved in disease aetiology. The data also provide strong evidence for the presence of multiple additional risk loci, each contributing a relatively small effect to BD susceptibility. Large samples are necessary to detect these risk loci. Here we present results from the largest BD GWAS to date by investigating 2.3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample of 24,025 patients and controls. We detect 56 genome-wide significant SNPs in five chromosomal regions including previously reported risk loci ANK3, ODZ4 and TRANK1, as well as the risk locus ADCY2 (5p15.31) and a region between MIR2113 and POU3F2 (6q16.1). ADCY2 is a key enzyme in cAMP signalling and our finding provides new insights into the biological mechanisms involved in the development of BD.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Vitamin D has been associated with a decreased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adulthood; however, some, but not all, previous studies have suggested that in utero vitamin D exposure may be a risk factor for MS later in life. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels in early pregnancy are associated with risk of MS in offspring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective, nested case-control study in the Finnish Maternity Cohort conducted in May 2011. We identified 193 individuals with a diagnosis of MS before December 31, 2009, whose mothers are in the Finnish Maternity Cohort and had an available serum sample from the pregnancy with the affected child. We matched 176 cases with 326 controls on region of birth in Finland, date of maternal serum sample collection, date of mother's birth, and date of child's birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Maternal serum 25(OH)D levels were measured using a chemiluminescence assay. The risk of MS among offspring and association with maternal 25(OH)D levels were the main outcomes. Conditional logistic regression was used and further adjusted for sex of the child, gestational age at the time of sample collection, and season of sample collection to estimate the relative risks and 95\% CIs. RESULTS: Of the 193 cases in the study, 163 were female. Of the 331 controls in the study, 218 were female. Seventy percent of serum samples were collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. The mean (SD) maternal vitamin D levels were in the insufficient vitamin D range, but higher in maternal control than case samples (15.02 [6.41] ng/mL vs 13.86 [5.49] ng/mL [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.496]). Maternal vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D levels {$<$}12.02 ng/mL) during early pregnancy was associated with a nearly 2-fold increased risk of MS in the offspring (relative risk, 1.90; 95\% CI, 1.20-3.01; P\,=\,.006) compared with women who did not have deficient 25(OH)D levels. There was no statistically significant association between the risk of MS and increasing serum 25(OH)D levels (P\,=\,.12). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Insufficient maternal 25(OH)D during pregnancy may increase the risk of MS in offspring.},

Meta-analyzing the two samples, we identify 255 genome-wide significant independent genomic regions, of which 138 are item-specific. Genetic analyses and genetic correlations with 33 external traits support genetic differences between the items. Hierarchical clustering analysis identifies two genetically homogeneous item clusters denoted depressed affect and worry.

At the time of analysis, previous genome-wide association studies7-12 (GWAS) reported 16 genomic loci associated to neuroticism10-12. Here we conducted a large GWAS meta-analysis (n\,=\,449,484) of neuroticism and identified 136 independent genome-wide significant loci (124 new at the time of analysis), which implicate 599 genes. Functional follow-up analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and involvement of specific cell types, including dopaminergic neuroblasts (P\,=\,3.49\,\texttimes\,10-8), medium spiny neurons (P\,=\,4.23\,\texttimes\,10-8), and serotonergic neurons (P\,=\,1.37\,\texttimes\,10-7).

We show that neuroticism's genetic signal partly originates in two genetically distinguishable subclusters13 ('depressed affect' and 'worry'), suggesting distinct causal mechanisms for subtypes of individuals. Mendelian randomization analysis showed unidirectional and bidirectional effects between neuroticism and multiple psychiatric traits. These results enhance neurobiological understanding of neuroticism and provide specific leads for functional follow-up experiments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Parkinson's disease have increased the scope of biological knowledge about the disease over the past decade. We aimed to use the largest aggregate of GWAS data to identify novel risk loci and gain further insight into the causes of Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of 17 datasets from Parkinson's disease GWAS available from European ancestry samples to nominate novel loci for disease risk. These datasets incorporated all available data. We then used these data to estimate heritable risk and develop predictive models of this heritability. We also used large gene expression and methylation resources to examine possible functional consequences as well as tissue, cell type, and biological pathway enrichments for the identified risk factors. Additionally, we examined shared genetic risk between Parkinson's disease and other phenotypes of interest via genetic correlations followed by Mendelian randomisation. FINDINGS: Between Oct 1, 2017, and Aug 9, 2018, we analysed 7{$\cdot$}8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms in 37\hphantom{,}688 cases, 18\hphantom{,}618 UK Biobank proxy-cases (ie, individuals who do not have Parkinson's disease but have a first degree relative that does), and 1{$\cdot$}4 million controls. We identified 90 independent genome-wide significant risk signals across 78 genomic regions, including 38 novel independent risk signals in 37 loci. These 90 variants explained 16-36\% of the heritable risk of Parkinson's disease depending on prevalence. Integrating methylation and expression data within a Mendelian randomisation framework identified putatively associated genes at 70 risk signals underlying GWAS loci for follow-up functional studies. Tissue-specific expression enrichment analyses suggested Parkinson's disease loci were heavily brain-enriched, with specific neuronal cell types being implicated from single cell data. We found significant genetic correlations with brain volumes (false discovery rate-adjusted p=0{$\cdot$}0035 for intracranial volume, p=0{$\cdot$}024 for putamen volume), smoking status (p=0{$\cdot$}024), and educational attainment (p=0{$\cdot$}038). Mendelian randomisation between cognitive performance and Parkinson's disease risk showed a robust association (p=8{$\cdot$}00\hphantom{,}\texttimes\hphantom{,}10-7). INTERPRETATION: These data provide the most comprehensive survey of genetic risk within Parkinson's disease to date, to the best of our knowledge, by revealing many additional Parkinson's disease risk loci, providing a biological context for these risk factors, and showing that a considerable genetic component of this disease remains unidentified. These associations derived from European ancestry datasets will need to be followed-up with more diverse data. FUNDING: The National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health (USA), The Michael J Fox Foundation, and The Parkinson's Foundation (see appendix for full list of funding sources).},

  abstract = {Summary: Runs of homozygosity (RoHs) are genomic stretches of a diploid genome that show identical alleles on both chromosomes. Longer RoHs are unlikely to have arisen by chance but are likely to denote autozygosity, whereby both copies of the genome descend from the same recent ancestor. Early tools to detect RoH used genotype array data, but substantially more information is available from sequencing data. Here, we present and evaluate BCFtools/RoH, an extension to the BCFtools software package, that detects regions of autozygosity in sequencing data, in particular exome data, using a hidden Markov model. By applying it to simulated data and real data from the 1000 Genomes Project we estimate its accuracy and show that it has higher sensitivity and specificity than existing methods under a range of sequencing error rates and levels of autozygosity., Availability and implementation: BCFtools/RoH and its associated binary/source files are freely available from https://github.com/samtools/BCFtools., Contact: vn2@sanger.ac.uk or pd3@sanger.ac.uk, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Mouse BTNL2 is a type I transmembrane protein with two pairs of Ig-like domains separated by a heptad peptide sequence. BTNL2 mRNA is highly expressed in lymphoid tissues as well as in intestine. To characterize the function of BTNL2, we produced a BTNL2-Ig fusion protein. It recognized a putative receptor whose expression on B and T cells was significantly enhanced after activation. BTNL2-Ig inhibited T cell proliferation and TCR activation of NFAT, NF-kappaB, and AP-1 signaling pathways. BTNL2 is thus the first member of the butyrophilin family that regulates T cell activation, which has implications in immune diseases and immunotherapy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: As previous research has suggested that exposure to vitamin D insufficiency in utero may have relevance for the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), we aimed to examine the direct association between level of neonatal vitamin D and risk of MS. METHODS: We carried out a matched case-control study. Dried blood spots samples (DBSS) belonging to 521 patients with MS were identified in the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank. For every patient with MS, 1-2 controls with the same sex and birth date were retrieved from the Biobank (n = 972). Level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in the DBSS was measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy. The association between different levels of 25(OH)D and risk of MS was evaluated by odds ratios (OR) calculated in conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: We observed that lower levels of 25(OH)D in neonates were associated with an increased risk of MS. In the analysis by quintiles, MS risk was highest among individuals in the bottom quintile ({$<$}20.7 nmol/L) and lowest among those in the top quintile of 25(OH)D ({$\geq$}48.9 nmol/L), with an OR for top vs bottom of 0.53 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.36-0.78). In the analysis treating 25(OH)D as a continuous variable, a 25 nmol/L increase in neonatal 25(OH)D resulted in a 30\% reduced risk of MS (OR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.57-0.84). CONCLUSION: Low concentrations of neonatal vitamin D are associated with an increased risk of MS. In light of the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency among pregnant women, our observation may have importance for public health.},

CD8(+) T-cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV(-) and untreated HIV(+) donors were pulsed with a cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus/influenza (CEF) peptide pool, and co-cultured with autologous memory CD8(+) T cells in the presence of IL-7. Cell survival and the function of memory CD8(+) T-cell subsets were then evaluated. Memory CD8(+) T-cell proliferation and interferon-{$\gamma$} (IFN-{$\gamma$}) production was enhanced by the presence of antigen, and the addition of IL-7 further enhanced antigen-induced proliferation. In HIV(+) individuals, the presence of antigen enhanced IFN-{$\gamma$} production to a small degree but did not enhance proliferation. Lastly, IL-7 did not enhance antigen-mediated proliferation of memory CD8(+) T cells from HIV(+) individuals. IL-7 therefore appears to have a role in secondary immune responses and its activity is impaired in memory CD8(+) T cells from HIV(+) individuals. These results further our understanding of the signals involved in secondary immune responses, and provide new insight into the loss of CD8(+) T-cell function in HIV infection.},

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes three COX subunits (I-III) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) encodes ten. In addition, ancillary proteins are required for the correct assembly and function of COX (refs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Although pathogenic mutations in mtDNA-encoded COX subunits have been described, no mutations in the nDNA-encoded subunits have been uncovered in any mendelian-inherited COX deficiency disorder. In yeast, two related COX assembly genes, SCO1 and SCO2 (for synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase), enable subunits I and II to be incorporated into the holoprotein. Here we have identified mutations in the human homologue, SCO2, in three unrelated infants with a newly recognized fatal cardioencephalomyopathy and COX deficiency. Immunohistochemical studies implied that the enzymatic deficiency, which was most severe in cardiac and skeletal muscle, was due to the loss of mtDNA-encoded COX subunits. The clinical phenotype caused by mutations in human SCO2 differs from that caused by mutations in SURF1, the only other known COX assembly gene associated with a human disease, Leigh syndrome.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the structure/function relationship between in vivo cerebellar size and higher cognitive function in a sample of healthy young subjects. The design of the study involved correlation of in vivo cerebellar volume measurements with measures of general intelligence (WAIS-R V\&P FSIQ, Vocabulary, Block Design, and Digit Span subtests), motor dexterity (Halstead-Reitan Finger Tapping), verbal (WMS Logical Memory), and visual (Rey-Osterrieth Figure) memory covaring for cerebrum size. A similar analysis was performed using left temporal lobe volumes as a control region. The sample consisted of 62 healthy subjects (30 females, 32 males) enrolled as controls at the MHCRC at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. This independent sample does not overlap with the groups studied in our previous report on the relationship between cerebellar and brain size and IQ. Cerebellar and total brain size were estimated through automatic, atlas-based volume measurements using MR images obtained with a T1-weighted three-dimensional SPGR sequence on a 1.5-T GE Signa scanner and locally developed software. Cerebellar volume significantly correlated with Finger Tapping (left hand: r = 0.218, p {$<$} 0.05; right hand: r = 0.211, p {$<$} 0.05) and with memory retention of complex narrative material (r = 0.27, p {$<$} 0.02). Cerebellar volume correlated with general intelligence in the expected direction (r = 0.19, p {$<$} 0.07). This study confirms previous work indicating that the cerebellum may make a contribution to several aspects of cognition. Cerebellar volume significantly correlated with the ability to retain already encoded information in the verbal domain and with fine motor dexterity. Cerebellar volume positively correlated with general but the relationship did not reach statistical significance. The structural/functional relationship between cerebellum and verbal memory abilities is consistent with evolutionary theory for the phylogenetical increase in the size of the cerebellum.},

Recent studies have shown that deconvolution algorithms can be applied to computationally estimate cell-type proportions from gene expression data of bulk blood samples, but their performance when applied to brain tissue is unclear. Here, we have generated an immunohistochemistry (IHC) dataset for five major cell-types from brain tissue of 70 individuals, who also have bulk cortical gene expression data. With the IHC data as the benchmark, this resource enables quantitative assessment of deconvolution algorithms for brain tissue. We apply existing deconvolution algorithms to brain tissue by using marker sets derived from human brain single cell and cell-sorted RNA-seq data. We show that these algorithms can indeed produce informative estimates of constituent cell-type proportions. In fact, neuronal subpopulations can also be estimated from bulk brain tissue samples. Further, we show that including the cell-type proportion estimates as confounding factors is important for reducing false associations between Alzheimer's disease phenotypes and gene expression. Lastly, we demonstrate that using more accurate marker sets can substantially improve statistical power in detecting cell-type specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).},

  abstract = {Glioblastoma (GB) is the most lethal, aggressive, and diffuse brain tumor. The main challenge for successful treatment is targeting the cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation responsible for tumor origin, progression, and recurrence. Chloride Intracellular Channel 1 (CLIC1), highly expressed in CSCs, is constitutively present in the plasma membrane where it is associated with chloride ion permeability. In vitro, CLIC1 inhibition leads to a significant arrest of GB CSCs in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, CLIC1 knockdown impairs tumor growth in vivo Here, we demonstrate that CLIC1 membrane localization and function is specific for GB CSCs. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) do not show CLIC1-associated chloride permeability, and inhibition of CLIC1 protein function has no influence on MSC cell-cycle progression. Investigation of the basic functions of GB CSCs reveals a constitutive state of oxidative stress and cytoplasmic alkalinization compared with MSCs. Both intracellular oxidation and cytoplasmic pH changes have been reported to affect CLIC1 membrane functional expression. We now report that in CSCs these three elements are temporally linked during CSC G1-S transition. Impeding CLIC1-mediated chloride current prevents both intracellular ROS accumulation and pH changes. CLIC1 membrane functional impairment results in GB CSCs resetting from an allostatic tumorigenic condition to a homeostatic steady state. In contrast, inhibiting NADPH oxidase and NHE1 proton pump results in cell death of both GB CSCs and MSCs. Our results show that CLIC1 membrane protein is crucial and specific for GB CSC proliferation, and is a promising pharmacologic target for successful brain tumor therapies.

  abstract = {The role of hypovitaminosis D as a possible risk factor for multiple sclerosis is reviewed. First, it is emphasized that hypovitaminosis D could be only one of the risk factors for multiple sclerosis and that numerous other environmental and genetic risk factors appear to interact and combine to trigger the disease. Secondly, the classical physiological notions about vitamin D have recently been challenged and the main new findings are summarized. This vitamin could have an important immunological role involving a number of organs and pathologies, including autoimmune diseases and multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, human requirements for this vitamin are much higher than previously thought, and in medium- or high-latitude countries, they might not be met in the majority of the general population due to a lack of sunshine and an increasingly urbanized lifestyle. Thereafter, the different types of studies that have helped to implicate hypovitaminosis D as a risk factor for multiple sclerosis are reviewed. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, vitamin D has been shown to play a significant immunological role. Diverse epidemiological studies suggest that a direct chain of causality exists in the general population between latitude, exposure to the sun, vitamin D status and the risk of multiple sclerosis. New epidemiological analyses from France support the existence of this chain of links. Recently reported immunological findings in patients with multiple sclerosis have consistently shown that vitamin D significantly influences regulatory T lymphocyte cells, whose role is well known in the pathogenesis of the disease. Lastly, in a number of studies on serum levels of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis, an insufficiency was observed in the great majority of patients, including at the earliest stages of the disease. The questionable specificity and significance of such results is detailed here. Based on a final global analysis of the cumulative significance of these different types of findings, it would appear likely that hypovitaminosis D is one of the risk factors for multiple sclerosis.},

In the present study, the time-course, over a 1 year period, of postischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy and/or development of congestive heart failure was investigated in mice in terms of survival and cardiac functional and structural characteristics. 2. C57BL/6 mice with myocardial infarction (MI mice; coronary ligation n = 78) or sham-operated animals (n = 45) were used and echocardiographic, haemodynamic and histomorphometric parameters were assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months post-MI. 3. At 12 months, the survival rate was 70\% in MI mice. Left ventricular dysfunction was evidenced by a strong decrease in ejection fraction (EF; -48 and -53\% at 6 and 12 months, respectively; both P {$<$} 0.05) and an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (+100\% at both 6 and 12 months; both P {$<$} 0.05). There was no major worsening in cardiac function between 6 and 12 months, suggesting strong compensatory mechanisms. Cardiac remodelling was observed, characterized by strong left ventricular hypertrophy (+38 and +62\% at 6 and 12 months, respectively; both P {$<$} 0.05) and dilatation (+53\% at 6 months; P {$<$} 0.05), but collagen was not significantly increased. Significant correlations were found between EF (echocardiography) and dP/dtmax, between end-diastolic volume (echocardiography) and left ventricular internal perimeter (histomorphometry) and between left ventricular mass (echocardiography) and weight. 4. In conclusion, despite a high survival rate, the MI mouse model displays most of the hallmarks of postischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy and/or congestive heart failure, thus affording the necessary background for the subsequent evaluation of gene manipulation and/or drug effects. In addition, two-dimensional echocardiography appears to be a suitable tool for the long-term follow up of cardiac function and remodelling in this model.},

  abstract = {1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+)) is widely used to induce a cellular model of Parkinson's disease (PD) in dopaminergic cell lines. Downregulation of the protein translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) has been reported in the brain tissue of PD patients. eEF1A2, an isoform of eEF1A, is associated with lysosome biogenesis that involves the autophagy process. However, the role of eEF1A2 on autophagic activity in PD has not been elucidated. In this work, we investigated the role of eEF1A2 on autophagy using eEF1A2 siRNA knockdown in differentiated SH-SY5Y neuronal cells treated with MPP(+). We found that eEF1A2 was upregulated in differentiated cells, which could be silenced by eEF1A2 siRNA. Significantly, cells treated with MPP(+) after eEF1A2 knockdown showed a decreased number of LC3 puncta, decreased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, and decreased phospho-Beclin-1, compared to the MPP(+) alone group. These cells showed extensive areas of mitochondria damage, with a reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, but reduced mitophagy as indicated by the reduced colocalization of LC3 puncta with damaged mitochondria. Cells with eEF1A2 siRNA plus MPP(+) treatment aggravated {$\alpha$}-synuclein accumulation but reduced colocalization with LC3. As a result, eEF1A2 knockdown decreased viability, increased apoptotic nuclei, increased caspase-3/7 activation and increased cleaved caspase-3 when cells were treated with MPP(+). These results suggest that eEF1A2 is essential for dopaminergic neuron survival against MPP(+), in part through autophagy regulation.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that defective RNA processing contributes to the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This may be especially true for ALS caused by a repeat expansion in C9orf72 (c9ALS), in which the accumulation of RNA foci and dipeptide-repeat proteins are expected to modify RNA metabolism. We report extensive alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) defects in the cerebellum of c9ALS cases (8,224 AS, 1,437 APA), including changes in ALS-associated genes (e.g. ATXN2 and FUS), and cases of sporadic ALS (sALS; 2,229 AS, 716 APA). Furthermore, hnRNPH and other RNA-binding proteins are predicted as potential regulators of cassette exon AS events for both c9ALS and sALS. Co-expression and gene-association network analyses of gene expression and AS data revealed divergent pathways associated with c9ALS and sALS.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease predisposing LRRK2 kinase phosphorylates a group of Rab GTPase proteins including Rab29, within the effector-binding switch II motif. Previous work indicated that Rab29, located within the PARK16 locus mutated in Parkinson's patients, operates in a common pathway with LRRK2. Here, we show that Rab29 recruits LRRK2 to the trans-Golgi network and greatly stimulates its kinase activity. Pathogenic LRRK2 R1441G/C and Y1699C mutants that promote GTP binding are more readily recruited to the Golgi and activated by Rab29 than wild-type LRRK2. We identify conserved residues within the LRRK2 ankyrin domain that are required for Rab29-mediated Golgi recruitment and kinase activation. Consistent with these findings, knockout of Rab29 in A549 cells reduces endogenous LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10. We show that mutations that prevent LRRK2 from interacting with either Rab29 or GTP strikingly inhibit phosphorylation of a cluster of highly studied biomarker phosphorylation sites (Ser910, Ser935, Ser955 and Ser973). Our data reveal that Rab29 is a master regulator of LRRK2, controlling its activation, localization, and potentially biomarker phosphorylation.},

Myosins are actin-based motors that power processes such as muscle contraction, cytokinesis, and organelle transport. Here we report the initial characterization of myosin-XIX (Myo19), the founding member of a novel class of myosin that associates with mitochondria. The 970 aa heavy chain consists of a motor domain, three IQ motifs, and a short tail. Myo19 mRNA is expressed in multiple tissues, and antibodies to human Myo19 detect an approximately 109 kDa band in multiple cell lines. Both endogenous Myo19 and GFP-Myo19 exhibit striking localization to mitochondria. Deletion analysis reveals that the Myo19 tail is necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial localization. Expressing full-length GFP-Myo19 in A549 cells reveals a remarkable gain of function where the majority of the mitochondria move continuously. Moving mitochondria travel for many micrometers with an obvious leading end and distorted shape. The motility and shape change are sensitive to latrunculin B, indicating that both are actin dependent. Expressing the GFP-Myo19 tail in CAD cells resulted in decreased mitochondrial run lengths in neurites. These results suggest that this novel myosin functions as an actin-based motor for mitochondrial movement in vertebrate cells.},

  abstract = {With ageing of the global society, the frequency of ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer`s disease (AD) is on the rise worldwide. Currently, there is no cure for AD, and the four drugs approved for AD only have very small effects on AD symptoms. Consequently, there are enormous efforts worldwide to identify new targets for treatment of AD. Approaches that interfere with classical neuropathologic features of AD, such as extracellular senile plaques formed of aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta), and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau have not been successful so far. In search for a treatment approach of AD, we found that inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by a centrally acting ACE inhibitor retards symptoms of neurodegeneration, Abeta plaque formation and tau hyperphosphorylation in experimental models of AD. Our approach is currently being investigated in a clinical setting. Initial evidence with AD patients shows that a brain-penetrating ACE inhibitor counteracts the process of neurodegeneration and dementia. Moreover, centrally acting ACE inhibitors given in addition to the standard therapy, cholinesterase inhibition, can improve cognitive function of AD patients for several months. This is one of the most promising results for AD treatment since more than a decade.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intellectual disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1\%-3\% of the population worldwide. It is characterised by high phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity and in most cases the underlying cause of the disorder is unknown. In our study we investigated a large consanguineous family from Baluchistan, Pakistan, comprising seven affected individuals with a severe form of autosomal recessive ID (ARID) and epilepsy, to elucidate a putative genetic cause. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) of a trio, including a child with ID and epilepsy and its healthy parents that were part of this large family, revealed a homozygous missense variant p.R53Q in the lectin mannose-binding 2-like (LMAN2L) gene. This homozygous variant was co-segregating in the family with the phenotype of severe ID and infantile epilepsy; unaffected family members were heterozygous variant carriers. The variant was predicted to be pathogenic by five different in silico programmes and further three-dimensional structure modelling of the protein suggests that variant p.R53Q may impair protein-protein interaction. LMAN2L (OMIM: 609552) encodes for the lectin, mannose-binding 2-like protein which is a cargo receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum important for glycoprotein transport. Genome-wide association studies have identified an association of LMAN2L to different neuropsychiatric disorders. CONCLUSION: This is the first report linking LMAN2L to a phenotype of severe ARID and seizures, indicating that the deleterious homozygous p.R53Q variant very likely causes the disorder.},

  abstract = {Accumulation of misfolded neurotoxic Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) protein found in both familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is recognized as an important contributing factor of neuronal cell death. However, little is known about the mechanisms controlling the accumulation and turnover of SOD1 protein. Puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA/NPEPPS) was recently identified as a major peptidase acting on neurotoxic TAU protein and protecting against TAU-induced neurodegeneration. In addition, recent report implicated PSA/NPEPPS in the direct removal of neurotoxic polyglutamine repeats. These combined data suggest that PSA/NPEPPS might represent a novel degradation pathway targeting pathologically aggregating neurotoxic protein substrates including SOD1. Here, we report that PSA/NPEPPS directly regulates SOD1 protein abundance and clearance via proteolysis. In addition, PSA/NPEPPS expression is significantly decreased in motor neurons of both SODG93A transgenic mice and sporadic ALS patients, suggesting its possible contribution to the disease pathogenesis. These results implicate SOD1 as a new target protein of PSA/NPEPPS and point to the possible neuroprotective role of PSA/NPEPPS in ALS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the causal effect of low serum 25(OH)D on multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility that is not confounded by environmental or lifestyle factors or subject to reverse causality. METHODS: We conducted mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using an instrumental variable (IV) comprising 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms found to be associated with serum 25(OH)D levels at genome-wide significance. We analyzed the effect of the IV on MS risk and both age at onset and disease severity in 2 separate populations using logistic regression models that controlled for sex, year of birth, smoking, education, genetic ancestry, body mass index at age 18-20 years or in 20s, a weighted genetic risk score for 110 known MS-associated variants, and the presence of one or more HLA-DRB1*15:01 alleles. RESULTS: Findings from MR analyses using the IV showed increasing levels of 25(OH)D are associated with a decreased risk of MS in both populations. In white, non-Hispanic members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (1,056 MS cases and 9,015 controls), the odds ratio (OR) was 0.79 (p = 0.04, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-0.99). In members of a Swedish population from the Epidemiological Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis and Genes and Environment in Multiple Sclerosis MS case-control studies (6,335 cases and 5,762 controls), the OR was 0.86 (p = 0.03, 95\% CI: 0.76-0.98). A meta-analysis of the 2 populations gave a combined OR of 0.85 (p = 0.003, 95\% CI: 0.76-0.94). No association was observed for age at onset or disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide strong evidence that low serum 25(OH)D concentration is a cause of MS, independent of established risk factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many aspects of autoimmune disease are not well understood, including the specificities of autoimmune targets, and patterns of co-morbidity and cross-heritability across diseases. Prior work has provided evidence that somatic mutation caused by gene conversion and deletion at segmentally duplicated loci is relevant to several diseases. Simple tandem repeat (STR) sequence is highly mutable, both somatically and in the germ-line, and somatic STR mutations are observed under inflammation. RESULTS: Protein-coding genes spanning STRs having markers of mutability, including germ-line variability, high total length, repeat count and/or repeat similarity, are evaluated in the context of autoimmunity. For the initiation of autoimmune disease, antigens whose autoantibodies are the first observed in a disease, termed primary autoantigens, are informative. Three primary autoantigens, thyroid peroxidase (TPO), phogrin (PTPRN2) and filaggrin (FLG), include STRs that are among the eleven longest STRs spanned by protein-coding genes. This association of primary autoantigens with long STR sequence is highly significant (p{$<$}3.0x10(-7)). Long STRs occur within twenty genes that are associated with sixteen common autoimmune diseases and atherosclerosis. The repeat within the TTC34 gene is an outlier in terms of length and a link with systemic lupus erythematosus is proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that many autoimmune diseases are triggered by immune responses to proteins whose DNA sequence mutates somatically in a coherent, consistent fashion. Other autoimmune diseases may be caused by coherent somatic mutations in immune cells. The coherent somatic mutation hypothesis has the potential to be a comprehensive explanation for the initiation of many autoimmune diseases.},

Genetic variants so far identified by genome-wide association studies explain only a small proportion ({$<$}2\%) of its variation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a meta-analysis of 28 genome-wide association studies including {$>$}90 000 subjects of European ancestry, the first genome-wide association meta-analysis of fibrinogen levels in 7 studies in blacks totaling 8289 samples, and a genome-wide association study in Hispanics totaling 1366 samples. Evaluation for association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms with clinical outcomes included a total of 40 695 cases and 85 582 controls for coronary artery disease, 4752 cases and 24 030 controls for stroke, and 3208 cases and 46 167 controls for venous thromboembolism. Overall, we identified 24 genome-wide significant (P{$<$}5\texttimes 10(-8)) independent signals in 23 loci, including 15 novel associations, together accounting for 3.7\% of plasma fibrinogen variation. Gene-set enrichment analysis highlighted key roles in fibrinogen regulation for the 3 structural fibrinogen genes and pathways related to inflammation, adipocytokines, and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone signaling. Whereas lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a few loci were significantly associated with coronary artery disease, the combined effect of all 24 fibrinogen-associated lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms was not significant for coronary artery disease, stroke, or venous thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS: We identify 23 robustly associated fibrinogen loci, 15 of which are new. Clinical outcome analysis of these loci does not support a causal relationship between circulating levels of fibrinogen and coronary artery disease, stroke, or venous thromboembolism.},

  abstract = {The degradation of dynorphin-related peptides by the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase M was examined using these peptides as alternate substrate inhibitors. Ki determinations showed that both aminopeptidases exhibit a higher affinity for longer dynorphin-related peptides, i.e., Ki for dynorphin A-17 = 23-30 nM with the Ki increasing to 25-50 microM for the enkephalin pentapeptides. Binding appears dependent not only on peptide length, but also on its sequence. With aminopeptidase M, as the peptide size increases from five to 10 amino acids, kcat remains relatively constant; however, as the peptide size increases beyond a decapeptide, kcat decreases significantly. With the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase, similar results were obtained except that kcat was greatest for the pentapeptide. Thus, if one considers kcat/Km as the relevant kinetic constant for estimating in vivo peptide hydrolysis, these results are consistent with the involvement of aminopeptidase M and the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase in the degradation of extended dynorphin-related peptides.},

The molecular basis of D-glyceric aciduria is largely unknown; possible causes that have been discussed are deficiencies of D-glycerate dehydrogenase, triokinase, and D-glycerate kinase. In 1989, van Schaftingen has reported decreased D-glycerate kinase activity in the liver of a single patient with D-glyceric aciduria. However, this analysis has not been performed in other affected individuals, and the underlying defect has remained unknown on the gene level until now. We report three patients with deficiency of D-glycerate kinase. They are of Serbian, Mexican, and Turkish origin and include the patient initially reported in 1974. All had homozygous mutations in exon 5 of the GLYCTK gene encoding D-glycerate kinase: c.1448delT (p.Phe483SerfsX2), c.1478T{$>$}G (p.Phe493Cys), or c.1558delC (p.Leu520CysfsX108). Transient overexpression of the variant GLYCTK genes in HEK293 cells clearly showed loss of enzyme activity and immunoreactivity when compared to the reference enzyme. Our work has revealed mutations in the GLYCTK gene as the cause of D-glycerate kinase deficiency and D-glyceric aciduria and provides a noninvasive approach for further diagnostic workup and research.},

  abstract = {Intelligence is highly heritable1 and a major determinant of human health and well-being2. Recent genome-wide meta-analyses have identified 24 genomic loci linked to variation in intelligence3-7, but much about its genetic underpinnings remains to be discovered. Here, we present a large-scale genetic association study of intelligence (n\,=\,269,867), identifying 205 associated genomic loci (190 new) and 1,016 genes (939 new) via positional mapping, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, chromatin interaction mapping, and gene-based association analysis. We find enrichment of genetic effects in conserved and coding regions and associations with 146 nonsynonymous exonic variants. Associated genes are strongly expressed in the brain, specifically in striatal medium spiny neurons and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Gene set analyses implicate pathways related to nervous system development and synaptic structure. We confirm previous strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization analysis results suggest protective effects of intelligence for Alzheimer's disease and ADHD and bidirectional causation with pleiotropic effects for schizophrenia. These results are a major step forward in understanding the neurobiology of cognitive function as well as genetically related neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Sequence variations occurring in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) support an essential function of microglia and innate immunity in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. TREM2 matures within the secretory pathway, and its ectodomain is shed on the plasma membrane. Missense mutations in the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain such as p.T66M and p.Y38C retain TREM2 within the endoplasmic reticulum and reduce shedding as well as TREM2-dependent phagocytosis. Using mass spectrometry, we have now determined the cleavage site of TREM2. TREM2 is shed by proteases of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain containing protein) family C-terminal to histidine 157, a position where an AD-associated coding variant has been discovered (p.H157Y) in the Han Chinese population. Opposite to the characterized mutations within the Ig-like domain, such as p.T66M and p.Y38C, the p.H157Y variant within the stalk region leads to enhanced shedding of TREM2. Elevated ectodomain shedding reduces cell surface full-length TREM2 and lowers TREM2-dependent phagocytosis. Therefore, two seemingly opposite cellular effects of TREM2 variants, namely reduced versus enhanced shedding, result in similar phenotypic outcomes by reducing cell surface TREM2.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of rickets is one of the oldest and most effective prophylactic measures in medicine, having virtually eradicated rickets in North America. Given the potentially toxic effects of vitamin D, the recommendations for the optimal dose are still debated, in part owing to the increased incidence of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia in Britain in the 1950s during a period of high vitamin D supplementation in fortified milk products. We investigated the molecular basis of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia, which is characterized by severe hypercalcemia, failure to thrive, vomiting, dehydration, and nephrocalcinosis. METHODS: We used a candidate-gene approach in a cohort of familial cases of typical idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia with suspected autosomal recessive inheritance. Identified mutations in the vitamin D-metabolizing enzyme CYP24A1 were evaluated with the use of a mammalian expression system. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of CYP24A1, which encodes 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase, the key enzyme of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) degradation, revealed recessive mutations in six affected children. In addition, CYP24A1 mutations were identified in a second cohort of infants in whom severe hypercalcemia had developed after bolus prophylaxis with vitamin D. Functional characterization revealed a complete loss of function in all CYP24A1 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CYP24A1 mutations explains the increased sensitivity to vitamin D in patients with idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia and is a genetic risk factor for the development of symptomatic hypercalcemia that may be triggered by vitamin D prophylaxis in otherwise apparently healthy infants.},

We performed an updated genome-wide AD meta-analysis, which identified 37 risk loci, including novel associations near genes CCDC6, TSPAN14, NCK2, and SPRED2. Using three SNP-level fine-mapping methods, we identified 21 SNPs with greater than 50\% probability each of being causally involved in AD risk, and others strongly suggested by functional annotation. We followed this with colocalisation analyses across 109 gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets, and prioritization of genes using protein interaction networks and tissue-specific expression. Combining this information into a quantitative score, we find that evidence converges on likely causal genes, including the above four genes, and those at previously discovered AD loci including BIN1, APH1B, PTK2B, PILRA, and CASS4.Competing Interest StatementJL is an employee of Biogen.

The predicted product shares 34\% sequence identity with the C(19) and C(21) 3beta-HSD enzymes, which participate in steroid hormone metabolism. When transfected into cultured cells, the cloned C(27) 3beta-HSD cDNA encodes an enzyme that is active against four 7alpha-hydroxylated sterols, indicating that a single C(27) 3beta-HSD enzyme can participate in all known pathways of bile acid synthesis. The expressed enzyme did not metabolize several different C(19/21) steroids as substrates. The levels of hepatic C(27) 3beta-HSD mRNA in the mouse are not sexually dimorphic and do not change in response to dietary cholesterol or to changes in bile acid pool size. The corresponding human gene on chromosome 16p11.2-12 contains six exons and spans 3 kb of DNA, and we identified a 2-bp deletion in the C27 3beta-HSD gene of a patient with neonatal progressive intrahepatic cholestasis. This mutation eliminates the activity of the enzyme in transfected cells. These findings establish the central role of C(27) 3beta-HSD in the biosynthesis of bile acids and provide molecular tools for the diagnosis of a third type of neonatal progressive intrahepatic cholestasis associated with impaired bile acid synthesis.},

Endogenous CDK inhibitors also modulate immune function via a CDK-independent pathway. Accordingly, systemic administration of small molecules that inhibit CDK may or may not ameliorate arthritis. To address this issue, alvocidib (flavopiridol), known to be tolerated clinically for treating cancers, and a newly synthesized CDK4/6-selective inhibitor were tested for antiarthritic effects. In vitro, they inhibited proliferation of human and mouse synovial fibroblasts without inducing apoptosis. In vivo, treatment of collagen-induced arthritis mice with alvocidib suppressed synovial hyperplasia and joint destruction, whereas serum concentrations of anti-collagen type II (CII) Abs and proliferative responses to CII were maintained. Treatment was effective even when therapeutically administered. Treated mice developed arthritis after termination of treatment. Thus, immune responses to CII were unimpaired. The same treatment ameliorated arthritis induced by K/BxN serum transfer to lymphocyte-deficient mice. Similarly, the CDK4/6-selective inhibitor suppressed collagen-induced arthritis. Both small-molecule CDK inhibitors were effective in treating animal models of rheumatoid arthritis not by suppressing lymphocyte function. Thus, the two small-molecule CDK inhibitors ameliorated arthritis models in a distinctive way, compared with other immunosuppressive drugs.},

  abstract = {A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells is a high priority for deciphering its mystery and curbing its spread. A virus surface spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. To fulfill its function, SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to its receptor human ACE2 (hACE2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is proteolytically activated by human proteases. Here we investigated receptor binding and protease activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike using biochemical and pseudovirus entry assays. Our findings have identified key cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. First, SARS-CoV-2 RBD has higher hACE2 binding affinity than SARS-CoV RBD, supporting efficient cell entry. Second, paradoxically, the hACE2 binding affinity of the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike is comparable to or lower than that of SARS-CoV spike, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RBD, albeit more potent, is less exposed than SARS-CoV RBD. Third, unlike SARS-CoV, cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is preactivated by proprotein convertase furin, reducing its dependence on target cell proteases for entry. The high hACE2 binding affinity of the RBD, furin preactivation of the spike, and hidden RBD in the spike potentially allow SARS-CoV-2 to maintain efficient cell entry while evading immune surveillance. These features may contribute to the wide spread of the virus. Successful intervention strategies must target both the potency of SARS-CoV-2 and its evasiveness.},

  abstract = {Most existing expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping studies have been focused on individuals of European ancestry and are underrepresented in other populations including populations with African ancestry. Lack of large-scale well-powered eQTL mapping studies in populations with African ancestry can both impede the dissemination of eQTL mapping results that would otherwise benefit individuals with African ancestry and hinder the comparable analysis for understanding how gene regulation is shaped through evolution. We fill this critical knowledge gap by performing a large-scale in-depth eQTL mapping study on 1,032 African Americans (AA) and 801 European Americans (EA) in the GENOA cohort. We identified a total of 354,931 eSNPs in AA and 371,309 eSNPs in EA, with 112,316~eSNPs overlapped between the two. We found that eQTL harboring genes (eGenes) are enriched in metabolic pathways and tend to have higher SNP heritability compared to non-eGenes. We found that eGenes that are common in the two populations tend to be less conserved than eGenes that are unique to one population, which are less conserved than non-eGenes. Through conditional analysis, we found that eGenes in AA tend to harbor more independent eQTLs than eGenes in EA, suggesting potentially diverse genetic architecture underlying expression variation in the two populations. Finally, the large sample sizes in GENOA allow us to construct accurate expression prediction models in both AA and EA, facilitating powerful transcriptome-wide association studies. Overall, our results represent an important step toward revealing the genetic architecture underlying expression variation in African Americans.},

  abstract = {Traditional linkage analysis and genome-wide association studies have identified HLA and a number of non-HLA genes as genetic factors for islet autoimmunity (IA) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the relative risk associated with previously identified non-HLA genes is usually very small as measured in cases/controls from mixed populations. Genetic associations for IA and T1D may be more accurately assessed in prospective cohorts. In this study, 5806 subjects from the TEDDY (The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young) study, an international prospective cohort study, were genotyped for 176,586 SNPs on the ImmunoChip. Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to discover the SNPs associated with the risk for IA, T1D, or both. Three regions were associated with the risk of developing any persistent confirmed islet autoantibody: one known region near SH2B3 (HR = 1.35, p = 3.58 \texttimes{} 10(-7)) with Bonferroni-corrected significance and another known region near PTPN22 (HR = 1.46, p = 2.17 \texttimes{} 10(-6)) and one novel region near PPIL2 (HR = 2.47, p = 9.64 \texttimes{} 10(-7)) with suggestive evidence (p {$<$} 10(-5)). Two known regions (PTPN22: p = 2.25 \texttimes{} 10(-6), INS; p = 1.32 \texttimes{} 10(-7)) and one novel region (PXK/PDHB: p = 8.99 \texttimes{} 10(-6)) were associated with the risk for multiple islet autoantibodies. First appearing islet autoantibodies differ with respect to association. Two regions (INS: p = 5.67 \texttimes{} 10(-6) and TTC34/PRDM16: 6.45 \texttimes{} 10(-6)) were associated if the fist appearing autoantibody was IAA and one region (RBFOX1: p = 8.02 \texttimes{} 10(-6)) was associated if the first appearing autoantibody was GADA. The analysis of T1D identified one region already known to be associated with T1D (INS: p = 3.13 \texttimes{} 10(-7)) and three novel regions (RNASET2, PLEKHA1, and PPIL2; 5.42 \texttimes{} 10(-6) {$>$} p {$>$} 2.31 \texttimes{} 10(-6)). These results suggest that a number of low frequency variants influence the risk of developing IA and/or T1D and these variants can be identified by large prospective cohort studies using a survival analysis approach.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Variability exists in the disease trajectories of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. We performed a genome-wide association study to examine rate of cognitive decline (ROD) in patients with AD. METHODS: We tested for interactions between genetic variants and time since diagnosis to predict the ROD of a composite cognitive score in 3946 AD cases and performed pathway analysis on the top genes. RESULTS: Suggestive associations (P {$<$} 1.0 \texttimes{} 10-6 ) were observed on chromosome 15 in DNA polymerase-{$\gamma$} (rs3176205, P = 1.11 \texttimes{} 10-7 ), chromosome 7 (rs60465337,P = 4.06 \texttimes{} 10-7 ) in contactin-associated protein-2, in RP11-384F7.1 on chromosome 3 (rs28853947, P = 5.93 \texttimes{} 10-7 ), family with sequence similarity 214 member-A on chromosome 15 (rs2899492, P = 5.94 \texttimes{} 10-7 ), and intergenic regions on chromosomes 16 (rs4949142, P = 4.02 \texttimes{} 10-7 ) and 4 (rs1304013, P = 7.73 \texttimes{} 10-7 ). Significant pathways involving neuronal development and function, apoptosis, memory, and inflammation were identified. DISCUSSION: Pathways related to AD, intelligence, and neurological function determine AD progression, while previously identified AD risk variants, including the apolipoprotein (APOE) {$\epsilon$}4 and {$\epsilon$}2 variants, do not have a major impact.},

  abstract = {The 13 polypeptides encoded in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix on a dedicated protein-translation apparatus that resembles that found in prokaryotes. Here, we have investigated the genetic basis for a mitochondrial protein-synthesis defect associated with a combined oxidative phosphorylation enzyme deficiency in two patients, one of whom presented with encephalomyopathy and the other with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Sequencing of candidate genes revealed the same homozygous mutation (C997T) in both patients in TSFM, a gene coding for the mitochondrial translation elongation factor EFTs. EFTs functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for EFTu, another translation elongation factor that brings aminoacylated transfer RNAs to the ribosomal A site as a ternary complex with guanosine triphosphate. The mutation predicts an Arg333Trp substitution at an evolutionarily conserved site in a subdomain of EFTs that interacts with EFTu. Molecular modeling showed that the substitution disrupts local subdomain structure and the dimerization interface. The steady-state levels of EFTs and EFTu in patient fibroblasts were reduced by 75\% and 60\%, respectively, and the amounts of assembled complexes I, IV, and V were reduced by 35\%-91\% compared with the amounts in controls. These phenotypes and the translation defect were rescued by retroviral expression of either EFTs or EFTu. These data clearly establish mutant EFTs as the cause of disease in these patients. The fact that the same mutation is associated with distinct clinical phenotypes suggests the presence of genetic modifiers of the mitochondrial translation apparatus.},

Intraocular pressure (IOP) and optic nerve head characteristics are used clinically to predict POAG risk. We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of IOP and optic disc parameters and validated our findings in multiple sets of POAG cases and controls. Using imputation to the 1000 genomes (1000G) reference set, we identified 9 new genomic regions associated with vertical cup-disc ratio (VCDR) and 1 new region associated with IOP. Additionally, we found 5 novel loci for optic nerve cup area and 6 for disc area. Previously it was assumed that genetic variation influenced POAG either through IOP or via changes to the optic nerve head; here we present evidence that some genomic regions affect both IOP and the disc parameters. We characterized the effect of the novel loci through pathway analysis and found that pathways involved are not entirely distinct as assumed so far. Further, we identified a novel association between CDKN1A and POAG. Using a zebrafish model we show that six6b (associated with POAG and optic nerve head variation) alters the expression of cdkn1a. In summary, we have identified several novel genes influencing the major clinical risk predictors of POAG and showed that genetic variation in CDKN1A is important in POAG risk.},

We identified two rare mutations (Q170H and R181G) in the prodomain of the metalloprotease, ADAM10, that cosegregate with late-onset AD (LOAD). Here, we addressed the pathogenicity of these mutations in transgenic mice expressing human ADAM10 in brain. In Tg2576 AD mice, both mutations attenuated {$\alpha$}-secretase activity of ADAM10 and shifted APP processing toward {$\beta$}-secretase-mediated cleavage, while enhancing A{$\beta$} plaque load and reactive gliosis. We also demonstrated ADAM10 expression potentiates adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is reduced by the LOAD mutations. Mechanistically, both LOAD mutations impaired the molecular chaperone activity of ADAM10 prodomain. Collectively, these findings suggest that diminished {$\alpha$}-secretase activity, owing to LOAD ADAM10 prodomain mutations, leads to AD-related pathology, strongly supporting ADAM10 as a promising therapeutic target for this devastating disease.},

  abstract = {Background There is a huge demand on bioinformaticians to provide their biologists with user friendly and scalable software infrastructures to capture, exchange, and exploit the unprecedented amounts of new *omics data. We here present MOLGENIS, a generic, open source, software toolkit to quickly produce the bespoke MOLecular GENetics Information Systems needed. Methods The MOLGENIS toolkit provides bioinformaticians with a simple language to model biological data structures and user interfaces. At the push of a button, MOLGENIS' generator suite automatically translates these models into a feature-rich, ready-to-use web application including database, user interfaces, exchange formats, and scriptable interfaces. Each generator is a template of SQL, JAVA, R, or HTML code that would require much effort to write by hand. This `model-driven' method ensures reuse of best practices and improves quality because the modeling language and generators are shared between all MOLGENIS applications, so that errors are found quickly and improvements are shared easily by a re-generation. A plug-in mechanism ensures that both the generator suite and generated product can be customized just as much as hand-written software. Results In recent years we have successfully evaluated the MOLGENIS toolkit for the rapid prototyping of many types of biomedical applications, including next-generation sequencing, GWAS, QTL, proteomics and biobanking. Writing 500 lines of model XML typically replaces 15,000 lines of hand-written programming code, which allows for quick adaptation if the information system is not yet to the biologist's satisfaction. Each application generated with MOLGENIS comes with an optimized database back-end, user interfaces for biologists to manage and exploit their data, programming interfaces for bioinformaticians to script analysis tools in R, Java, SOAP, REST/JSON and RDF, a tab-delimited file format to ease upload and exchange of data, and detailed technical documentation. Existing databases can be quickly enhanced with MOLGENIS generated interfaces using the `ExtractModel' procedure. Conclusions The MOLGENIS toolkit provides bioinformaticians with a simple model to quickly generate flexible web platforms for all possible genomic, molecular and phenotypic experiments with a richness of interfaces not provided by other tools. All the software and manuals are available free as LGPLv3 open source at http://www.molgenis.org.},

Transfected cells were enriched for survivors over two successive rounds of IL-3 withdrawal and reconstitution, resulting in the identification of a full-length elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1alpha) cDNA. Ectopic EF-1alpha expression conferred protection from growth factor withdrawal and agents that induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, but not from nuclear damage or death receptor signaling. Overexpression of EF-1alpha did not lead to growth factor independent cell proliferation or global alterations in protein levels or rates of synthesis. These findings suggest that overexpression of EF-1alpha results in selective resistance to apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal and ER stress.},

Using nanopore reads, we demonstrate differential 3' splice site changes associated with SF3B1 mutation, agreeing with previous studies. We also observe a strong downregulation of intron retention events associated with SF3B1 mutation. Full-length transcript analysis links multiple alternative splicing events together and allows for better estimates of the abundance of productive versus unproductive isoforms.

  abstract = {Myopia, or near-sightedness, is an ocular refractive error of unfocused image quality in front of the retinal plane. Individuals with high-grade myopia (dioptric power greater than -6.00) are predisposed to ocular morbidities such as glaucoma, retinal detachment, and myopic maculopathy. Nonsyndromic, high-grade myopia is highly heritable, and to date multiple gene loci have been reported. We performed exome sequencing in 4 individuals from an 11-member family of European descent from the United States. Affected individuals had a mean dioptric spherical equivalent of -22.00 sphere. A premature stop codon mutation c.157C{$>$}T (p.Gln53*) cosegregating with disease was discovered within SCO2 that maps to chromosome 22q13.33. Subsequent analyses identified three additional mutations in three highly myopic unrelated individuals (c.341G{$>$}A, c.418G{$>$}A, and c.776C{$>$}T). To determine differential gene expression in a developmental mouse model, we induced myopia by applying a -15.00D lens over one eye. Messenger RNA levels of SCO2 were significantly downregulated in myopic mouse retinae. Immunohistochemistry in mouse eyes confirmed SCO2 protein localization in retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and sclera. SCO2 encodes for a copper homeostasis protein influential in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity. Copper deficiencies have been linked with photoreceptor loss and myopia with increased scleral wall elasticity. Retinal thinning has been reported with an SC02 variant. Human mutation identification with support from an induced myopic animal provides biological insights of myopic development.},

In the present study, we identify a novel protein, nucleostemin, found in the nucleoli of CNS stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and several cancer cell lines and preferentially expressed by other stem cell-enriched populations. It contains an N-terminal basic domain and two GTP-binding motifs. When stem cells differentiate, nucleostemin expression decreases rapidly prior to cell-cycle exit both in vitro and in vivo. Depletion or overexpression of nucleostemin reduces cell proliferation in CNS stem cells and transformed cells. Mutation analysis indicates that excessive nucleostemin, particularly mutants that lack the GTP-regulatory domain, prevents cells from entering mitosis and causes apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. The N-terminal basic domain specifies nucleolar localization, the p53 interaction, and is required for the cell death caused by overexpression. This work describes a novel nucleolar mechanism that controls the cell-cycle progression in CNS stem cells and cancer cells.},

A new approach enabling rapid 3D printing of hydrogels in aqueous solutions is presented on the basis of UV-curable inks containing nanoparticles of highly efficient but water-insoluble photoinitiators. The extinction coefficient of the new water-dispersible nanoparticles of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl-diphenylphosphine oxide (TPO) is more than 300 times larger than the best and most used commercially available water-soluble photoinitiator. The TPO nanoparticles absorb significantly in the range from 385 to 420 nm, making them suitable for use in commercially available, low-cost, light-emitting diode\textendash based 3D printers using digital light processing. The polymerization rate at this range is very fast and enables 3D printing that otherwise is impossible to perform without adding solvents. The TPO nanoparticles were prepared by rapid conversion of volatile microemulsions into water-dispersible powder, a process that can be used for a variety of photoinitiators. Such water-dispersible photoinitiator nanoparticles open many opportunities to enable rapid 3D printing of structures prepared in aqueous solutions while bringing environmental advantages by using low-energy curing systems and avoiding the need for solvents.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Familial AD typically results from mutations in the genes encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 or presenilin 2. Variations in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), one of several genes for which expression is restricted to microglia in the brain, have now been shown to increase the risk of developing late-onset AD. Microglia have been shown to respond to A{$\beta$} accumulation and neurodegenerative lesions, progressively acquiring a unique transcriptional and functional signature and evolving into disease-associated microglia (DAM). DAM attenuate the progression of neurodegeneration in certain mouse models, but inappropriate DAM activation accelerates neurodegenerative disease in other models. TREM2 is essential for maintaining microglial metabolic fitness during stress events, enabling microglial progression to a fully mature DAM profile and ultimately sustaining the microglial response to A{$\beta$}-plaque-induced pathology. Here, we review the current data detailing the role of TREM2 in microglial biology and AD.},

Although the latter by far outnumber the former, the vast majority of mitochondrial translation defects in humans have been associated with mutations in RNA-encoding mtDNA genes, whereas mutations in protein-encoding nuclear genes have been identified in a handful of cases. Genetic investigation involving patients with defective mitochondrial translation led us to the discovery of novel mutations in the mitochondrial elongation factor G1 (EFG1) in one affected baby and, for the first time, in the mitochondrial elongation factor Tu (EFTu) in another one. Both patients were affected by severe lactic acidosis and rapidly progressive, fatal encephalopathy. The EFG1-mutant patient had early-onset Leigh syndrome, whereas the EFTu-mutant patient had severe infantile macrocystic leukodystrophy with micropolygyria. Structural modeling enabled us to make predictions about the effects of the mutations at the molecular level. Yeast and mammalian cell systems proved the pathogenic role of the mutant alleles by functional complementation in vivo. Nuclear-gene abnormalities causing mitochondrial translation defects represent a new, potentially broad field of mitochondrial medicine. Investigation of these defects is important to expand the molecular characterization of mitochondrial disorders and also may contribute to the elucidation of the complex control mechanisms, which regulate this fundamental pathway of mtDNA homeostasis.},

BTNL2 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and has been implicated as a costimulatory molecule involved in T-cell activation on the basis of its homology to B7-1. The G --{$>$} A transition constituting rs2076530 leads to the use of a cryptic splice site located 4 bp upstream of the affected wild-type donor site.

  abstract = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of presenile dementia. The predominant neuropathology is FTLD with TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) inclusions (FTLD-TDP). FTLD-TDP is frequently familial, resulting from mutations in GRN (which encodes progranulin). We assembled an international collaboration to identify susceptibility loci for FTLD-TDP through a genome-wide association study of 515 individuals with FTLD-TDP. We found that FTLD-TDP associates with multiple SNPs mapping to a single linkage disequilibrium block on 7p21 that contains TMEM106B. Three SNPs retained genome-wide significance following Bonferroni correction (top SNP rs1990622, P = 1.08 x 10(-11); odds ratio, minor allele (C) 0.61, 95\% CI 0.53-0.71). The association replicated in 89 FTLD-TDP cases (rs1990622; P = 2 x 10(-4)). TMEM106B variants may confer risk of FTLD-TDP by increasing TMEM106B expression. TMEM106B variants also contribute to genetic risk for FTLD-TDP in individuals with mutations in GRN. Our data implicate variants in TMEM106B as a strong risk factor for FTLD-TDP, suggesting an underlying pathogenic mechanism.},

  abstract = {C-type lectins are key players in immune regulation by driving distinct functions of antigen-presenting cells. The C-type lectin CLEC16A gene is located at 16p13, a susceptibility locus for several autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis. However, the function of this gene and its potential contribution to these diseases in humans are poorly understood. In this study, we found a strong upregulation of CLEC16A expression in the white matter of multiple sclerosis patients (n = 14) compared to non-demented controls (n = 11), mainly in perivascular leukocyte infiltrates. Moreover, CLEC16A levels were significantly enhanced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of multiple sclerosis patients (n = 69) versus healthy controls (n = 46). In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, CLEC16A was most abundant in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, in which it strongly co-localized with human leukocyte antigen class II. Treatment of these professional antigen-presenting cells with vitamin D, a key protective environmental factor in multiple sclerosis, downmodulated CLEC16A in parallel with human leukocyte antigen class II. Knockdown of CLEC16A in distinct types of model and primary antigen-presenting cells resulted in severely impaired cytoplasmic distribution and formation of human leucocyte antigen class II-positive late endosomes, as determined by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Mechanistically, CLEC16A participated in the molecular machinery of human leukocyte antigen class II-positive late endosome formation and trafficking to perinuclear regions, involving the dynein motor complex. By performing co-immunoprecipitations, we found that CLEC16A directly binds to two critical members of this complex, RILP and the HOPS complex. CLEC16A silencing in antigen-presenting cells disturbed RILP-mediated recruitment of human leukocyte antigen class II-positive late endosomes to perinuclear regions. Together, we identify CLEC16A as a pivotal gene in multiple sclerosis that serves as a direct regulator of the human leukocyte antigen class II pathway in antigen-presenting cells. These findings are a first step in coupling multiple sclerosis-associated genes to the regulation of the strongest genetic factor in multiple sclerosis, human leukocyte antigen class II.},

  abstract = {For half a century, the human brain was believed to contain about 100 billion neurons and one trillion glial cells, with a glia:neuron ratio of 10:1. A new counting method, the isotropic fractionator, has challenged the notion that glia outnumber neurons and revived a question that was widely thought to have been resolved. The recently validated isotropic fractionator demonstrates a glia:neuron ratio of less than 1:1 and a total number of less than 100 billion glial cells in the human brain. A survey of original evidence shows that histological data always supported a 1:1 ratio of glia to neurons in the entire human brain, and a range of 40\textendash 130 billion glial cells. We review how the claim of one trillion glial cells originated, was perpetuated, and eventually refuted. We compile how numbers of neurons and glial cells in the adult human brain were reported and we examine the reasons for an erroneous consensus about the relative abundance of glial cells in human brains that persisted for half a century. Our review includes a brief history of cell counting in human brains, types of counting methods that were and are employed, ranges of previous estimates, and the current status of knowledge about the number of cells. We also discuss implications and consequences of the new insights into true numbers of glial cells in the human brain, and the promise and potential impact of the newly validated isotropic fractionator for reliable quantification of glia and neurons in neurological and psychiatric diseases.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}ABSTRACT{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The genotype II.4 (GII.4) variants of human noroviruses (HuNVs) are recognized as the major agent of global gastroenteritis outbreaks. Due to the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNV propagation, the exact roles of HuNV-encoded nonstructural proteins (including Nterm, NTPase, P22, VPg, Pro, and RdRp) in viral replication or pathogenesis have not yet been fully understood. Here, we report the molecular characterization of the GII.4 HuNV-encoded NTPase (designated GII-NTPase). Results from our studies showed that GII-NTPase forms vesicular or nonvesicular textures in the cell cytoplasm, and the nonvesicular fraction of GII-NTPase significantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria. Deletion analysis revealed that the N-terminal 179-amino-acid (aa) region of GII-NTPase is required for vesicle formation and for ER colocalization, whereas the C-terminal region is involved in mitochondrial colocalization. In particular, two mitochondrion-targeting domains were identified in the C-terminal region of GII-NTPase which perfectly colocalized with mitochondria when the N-terminal region of GII-NTPase was deleted. However, the corresponding C-terminal portions of NTPase derived from the GI HuNV did not show mitochondrial colocalization. We also found that GII-NTPase physically interacts with itself as well as with Nterm and P22, but not VPg, Pro, and RdRp, in cells. The Nterm- and P22-interacting region was mapped to the N-terminal 179-aa region of GII-NTPase, whereas the self-assembly of GII-NTPase could be achieved via a head-to-head, tail-to-tail, or head-to-tail configuration. More importantly, we demonstrate that GII-NTPase possesses a proapoptotic activity, which can be further enhanced by coexpression with Nterm or P22.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}\textbf{IMPORTANCE} Despite the importance of human norovirus GII.4 variants in global gastroenteritis outbreaks, the basic biological functions of the viral nonstructural proteins in cells remain rarely investigated. In this report, we focus our studies on characteristics of the GII.4 norovirus-encoded NTPase (GII-NTPase). We unexpectedly find that GII-NTPase can perfectly colocalize with mitochondria after its N-terminal region is deleted. However, such a phenomenon is not observed for NTPase encoded by a GI strain. We further reveal that the N-terminal 179-aa region of GII-NTPase is sufficient to mediate (i) vesicle formation, (ii) ER colocalization, (iii) the interaction with two other nonstructural proteins, including Nterm and P22, (iv) the formation of homodimers or homo-oligomers, and (v) the induction of cell apoptosis. Taken together, our findings emphasize that the virus-encoded NTPase must have multiple activities during viral replication or pathogenesis; however, these activities may vary somewhat among different genogroups.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Transcriptome-wide association analysis detected 3,568 T2D associations with genetically predicted gene expression in 687 novel genes; of these, 54 are known to interact with FDA-approved drugs. A polygenic risk score (PRS) was strongly associated with increased risk of T2D-related retinopathy and modestly associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) and neuropathy. We investigated the genetic etiology of T2D-related vascular outcomes in the MVP and observed statistical SNP-T2D interactions at 13 variants, including coronary heart disease (CHD), CKD, PAD and neuropathy. These findings may help to identify potential therapeutic targets for T2D and genomic pathways that link T2D to vascular outcomes.},

In discovery (N = 74,064) and follow-up studies (N = 48,607), we identified at genome-wide significance (P = 2.7 \texttimes{} 10(-8) to P = 2.3 \texttimes{} 10(-13)) four new PP loci (at 4q12 near CHIC2, 7q22.3 near PIK3CG, 8q24.12 in NOV and 11q24.3 near ADAMTS8), two new MAP loci (3p21.31 in MAP4 and 10q25.3 near ADRB1) and one locus associated with both of these traits (2q24.3 near FIGN) that has also recently been associated with SBP in east Asians. For three of the new PP loci, the estimated effect for SBP was opposite of that for DBP, in contrast to the majority of common SBP- and DBP-associated variants, which show concordant effects on both traits. These findings suggest new genetic pathways underlying blood pressure variation, some of which may differentially influence SBP and DBP.},

  abstract = {Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONStrong genetic associations have been found for a number of psychiatric disorders. However, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms remains challenging. RATIONALETo address this challenge, the PsychENCODE Consortium has developed a comprehensive online resource and integrative models for the functional genomics of the human brain. RESULTSThe base of the pyramidal resource is the datasets generated by PsychENCODE, including bulk transcriptome, chromatin, genotype, and Hi-C datasets and single-cell transcriptomic data from \textasciitilde 32,000 cells for major brain regions. We have merged these with data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and single-cell analyses. Via uniform processing, we created a harmonized resource, allowing us to survey functional genomics data on the brain over a sample size of 1866 individuals.From this uniformly processed dataset, we created derived data products. These include lists of brain-expressed genes, coexpression modules, and single-cell expression profiles for many brain cell types; \textasciitilde 79,000 brain-active enhancers with associated Hi-C loops and topologically associating domains; and \textasciitilde 2.5 million expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs) comprising \textasciitilde 238,000 linkage-disequilibrium\textendash independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms and of other types of QTLs associated with splice isoforms, cell fractions, and chromatin activity. By using these, we found that {$>$}88\% of the cross-population variation in brain gene expression can be accounted for by cell fraction changes. Furthermore, a number of disorders and aging are associated with changes in cell-type proportions. The derived data also enable comparison between the brain and other tissues. In particular, by using spectral analyses, we found that the brain has distinct expression and epigenetic patterns, including a greater extent of noncoding transcription than other tissues.The top level of the resource consists of integrative networks for regulation and machine-learning models for disease prediction. The networks include a full gene regulatory network (GRN) for the brain, linking transcription factors, enhancers, and target genes from merging of the QTLs, generalized element-activity correlations, and Hi-C data. By using this network, we link disease genes to genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants for psychiatric disorders. For schizophrenia, we linked 321 genes to the 142 reported GWAS loci. We then embedded the regulatory network into a deep-learning model to predict psychiatric phenotypes from genotype and expression. Our model gives a \textasciitilde 6-fold improvement in prediction over additive polygenic risk scores. Moreover, it achieves a \textasciitilde 3-fold improvement over additive models, even when the gene expression data are imputed, highlighting the value of having just a small amount of transcriptome data for disease prediction. Lastly, it highlights key genes and pathways associated with disorder prediction, including immunological, synaptic, and metabolic pathways, recapitulating de novo results from more targeted analyses. CONCLUSIONOur resource and integrative analyses have uncovered genomic elements and networks in the brain, which in turn have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. Our deep-learning model improves disease risk prediction over traditional approaches and can be extended with additional data types (e.g., microRNA and neuroimaging). {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6420/eaat8464/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A comprehensive functional genomic resource for the adult human brain.The resource forms a three-layer pyramid. The bottom layer includes sequencing datasets for traits, such as schizophrenia. The middle layer represents derived datasets, including functional genomic elements and QTLs.

DSPN, Deep Structured Phenotype Network; PC1 and PC2, principal components 1 and 2; ref, reference; alt, alternate; H3K27ac, histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27. Despite progress in defining genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Addressing this, the PsychENCODE Consortium has generated a comprehensive online resource for the adult brain across 1866 individuals. The PsychENCODE resource contains \textasciitilde 79,000 brain-active enhancers, sets of Hi-C linkages, and topologically associating domains; single-cell expression profiles for many cell types; expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs); and further QTLs associated with chromatin, splicing, and cell-type proportions. Integration shows that varying cell-type proportions largely account for the cross-population variation in expression (with {$>$}88\% reconstruction accuracy). It also allows building of a gene regulatory network, linking genome-wide association study variants to genes (e.g., 321 for schizophrenia). We embed this network into an interpretable deep-learning model, which improves disease prediction by \textasciitilde 6-fold versus polygenic risk scores and identifies key genes and pathways in psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Non-coding transcriptional regulatory elements are critical for controlling the spatiotemporal expression of genes. Here, we demonstrate that the sizes and number of enhancers linked to a gene reflect its disease pathogenicity. Moreover, genes with redundant enhancer domains are depleted of cis-acting genetic variants that disrupt gene expression, and they are buffered against the effects of disruptive non-coding mutations. Our results demonstrate that dosage-sensitive genes have evolved a robustness to the disruptive effects of genetic variation by expanding their regulatory domains. This solves a puzzle about why genes associated with human disease are depleted of cis-eQTLs (cis-expression quantitative trait loci), suggesting that this relationship might complicate gene identification in causal genome-wide association studies (GWASs) using eQTL information, and establishes a framework for identifying non-coding regulatory variation with phenotypic consequences.},

Tetraspanin 31 (TSPAN31), recently discovered to be linked to cancer, has not yet been studied in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we show that TSPAN31 is the natural antisense transcript of cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and regulates the expression of CDK4 mRNA and protein. Target analysis indicates that miR-135b can directly regulate TSPAN31 expression. miR-135b-induced TSPAN31 silencing increases CDK4 protein levels. Interestingly, p53 negatively regulates TSPAN31 expression. siRNA-induced TSPAN31 knockdown reduces the expression of Akt signaling pathway components phosphorylated Akt, p-GSK3{$\beta$} and {$\beta$}-catenin, and restrains {$\beta$}-catenin migration to cell nucleus. TSPAN31 knockdown also significantly inhibits HCC cell invasion and migration. These findings thus point to TSPAN31 as a novel regulator in transduction of intracellular survival and apoptotic signals.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive disease caused by loss-of-function dystrophin (DMD) mutations in boys, who typically suffer loss of ambulation by age 12. Previously, we reported that coding variants in latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF{$\beta$})-binding protein 4 (LTBP4) were associated with reduced TGF{$\beta$} signaling and prolonged ambulation (p\,=\,1.0\,\texttimes\,10-3 ) in DMD patients; this result was subsequently replicated by other groups. In this study, we evaluated whether additional DMD modifier genes are observed using whole-genome association in the original cohort. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing loss of ambulation (LOA) in the same cohort of 253 DMD patients used to detect the candidate association with LTBP4 coding variants. Gene expression and chromatin interaction databases were used to fine-map association signals above the threshold for genome-wide significance. RESULTS: Despite the small sample size, two loci associated with prolonged ambulation met genome-wide significance and were tagged by rs2725797 (chr15, p\,=\,6.6\,\texttimes\,10-9 ) and rs710160 (chr19, p\,=\,4.7\,\texttimes\,10-8 ). Gene expression and chromatin interaction data indicated that the latter SNP tags regulatory variants of LTBP4, whereas the former SNP tags regulatory variants of thrombospondin-1 (THBS1): an activator of TGF{$\beta$} signaling by direct binding to LTBP4 and an inhibitor of proangiogenic nitric oxide signaling. INTERPRETATION: Together with previous evidence implicating LTBP4, the THBS1 modifier locus emphasizes the role that common regulatory variants in gene interaction networks can play in mitigating disease progression in muscular dystrophy.

From a series of twelve consecutively diagnosed cases with propionic acidemia, we report on eight patients with autistic features. The patients were followed 2-4 times a year and underwent regular clinical, dietary and laboratory investigations. Psychological evaluation was performed every second to fourth year. All patients were compliant with the standard diet and carnitine supplementation. None of the patients had frequent metabolic decompensations. From the metabolic factors known to impact neuropsychological outcome we detected chronically decreased valine levels and altered valine to leucine ratios in five out of the eight patients. Recurrent lactic acid elevations were present in six out of the eight patients. Five of the eight patients were diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, four of them had pathogenic variants in PCCB. Disorder according to DSM-IV and/or DSM-5 criteria. One of the patients diagnosed with propionic acidemia by newborn screening had the most significant behavioral features and another was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder prior to propionic acidemia.

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have laid the foundation for investigations into the biology of complex traits, drug development and clinical guidelines. However, the majority of discovery efforts are based on data from populations of European ancestry1-3. In light of the differential genetic architecture that is known to exist between populations, bias in representation can exacerbate existing disease and healthcare disparities. Critical variants may be missed if they have a low frequency or are completely absent in European populations, especially as the field shifts its attention towards rare variants, which are more likely to be population-specific4-10. Additionally, effect sizes and their derived risk prediction scores derived in one population may not accurately extrapolate to other populations11,12. Here we demonstrate the value of diverse, multi-ethnic participants in large-scale genomic studies. The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study conducted a GWAS of 26 clinical and behavioural phenotypes in 49,839~non-European individuals. Using strategies tailored for analysis of multi-ethnic and admixed populations, we describe a framework for analysing diverse populations, identify 27 novel loci and 38 secondary signals at known loci, as well as replicate 1,444 GWAS catalogue associations across these traits. Our data show evidence of effect-size heterogeneity across ancestries for published GWAS associations, substantial benefits for fine-mapping using diverse cohorts and insights into clinical implications. In the United States-where minority populations have a disproportionately higher burden of chronic conditions13-the lack of representation of diverse populations in genetic research will result in inequitable access to precision medicine for those with the highest burden of disease. We strongly advocate for continued, large genome-wide efforts in diverse populations to maximize genetic discovery and reduce health disparities.},

Although the etiology of sALS remains unknown, genetic variants are thought to predispose individuals to the disease. Several recent genome-wide association studies have identified a number of loci that increase sALS susceptibility, but these only explain a small proportion of the disease. To extend the current genetic evidence and to identify novel candidates of sALS, we performed a pooling genome-wide association study by 859,311 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms of IlluminaHumanOmniZhongHua-8 combining pathway analysis in 250 typical sALS cases precluding age, clinical course, and phenotype interference and 250 control subjects from Chinese Han populations (CHP). The results revealed that 8 novel loci of 1p34.3, 3p21.1, 3p22.2, 10p15.2, 22q12.1, 3q13.11, 11q25, 12q24.33, and 5 previously reported loci of CNTN4 (kgp11325216), ATXN1 (kgp8327591), C9orf72 (kgp6016770), ITPR2 (kgp3041552), and SOD1 (kgp10760302) were associated with sALS from CHP. Furthermore, the pathway analysis based on the Gene Set Analysis Toolkit V2 showed that 10 top pathways were strongly associated with sALS from CHP, and among them, the 7 most potentially candidate pathways were phosphatidylinositol signaling system, Wnt signaling pathway, axon guidance, MAPK signaling pathway, neurotrophin signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, and T-cell receptor signaling pathway, a total of 39 significantly associate genes in 7 candidate pathways was suggested to involve in the pathogenesis of sALS from CHP. In conclusion, our results revealed several new loci and pathways related to sALS from CHP and extend the association evidence for partial loci, genes, and pathways, which were previously identified in other populations. Thus, our data provided new clues for exploring the pathogenesis of sALS.},

  abstract = {CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, and the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) share several tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) adaptor proteins for signaling. Among these, TRAF3 was the first identified to directly bind both receptors, yet its role remains a mystery. To address this, we generated B cell lines deficient in TRAF3 by homologous recombination. We found that CD40 signals were normal in the absence of TRAF3, with the exception of moderately enhanced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and antibody secretion. In sharp contrast, LMP1 signaling was markedly defective in TRAF3-/- B cells. LMP1-induced activation of JNK and nuclear factor kappaB, up-regulation of CD23 and CD80, and antibody secretion were substantially affected by TRAF3 deficiency. Reconstitution of TRAF3 expression decreased CD40-induced JNK activation and antibody secretion, and fully restored LMP1 signaling. Although TRAF2 is widely believed to be important for LMP1 function, LMP1 signaling was intact in TRAF2-/- B cells. Our data reveal that CD40 and LMP1 unexpectedly use TRAF3 in different ways, and that TRAF3 is required for LMP1-mediated activation of B cells.},

As such, it is predicted that SET8 might be involved in the development and progression of tumour. However, whether and how SET8 might be implicated in tumourigenesis is currently unknown. Here, we report that SET8 is physically associated with TWIST, a master regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We demonstrated that SET8 and TWIST are functionally interdependent in promoting EMT and enhancing the invasive potential of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We showed that SET8 acts as a dual epigenetic modifier on the promoters of the TWIST target genes E-cadherin and N-cadherin via its H4K20 monomethylation activity. Significantly, in breast carcinoma samples, SET8 expression is positively correlated with metastasis and the expression of TWIST and N-cadherin and negatively correlated with E-cadherin. Together, our experiments revealed a novel role for SET8 in tumour invasion and metastasis and provide a molecular mechanism underlying TWIST-promoted EMT, suggesting SET8 as a potential target for intervention of the metastasis of breast cancer.},

In our study, furin protein was increased in the temporal neocortex of epileptic patients and in the hippocampus and cortex of epileptic mice. The furin transgenic (TG) mice showed increased susceptibility to epilepsy and heightened epileptic activity compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Conversely, lentivirus-mediated knockdown of furin restrained epileptic activity. Using whole-cell patch clamp, furin knockdown and overexpression influenced neuronal inhibitory by regulating postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAAR)-mediated synaptic transmission. Importantly, furin influenced the expression of GABAAR {$\beta$}2/3 membrane and total protein in epileptic mice by changing transcription level of GABAAR {$\beta$}2/3, not the protein degradation. These results reveal that furin may regulate GABAAR-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission by altering the transcription of GABAAR {$\beta$}2/3 subunits in epilepsy; this finding could provide new insight into epilepsy prevention and treatment.},

The association between the grey matter (GM) structural network and intelligence and cognition is not well understood. We applied a multivariate approach to identify the pattern of GM and link the structural network to intelligence and cognitive functions. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was acquired from 92 healthy individuals. Source-based morphometry analysis was applied to the imaging data to extract GM structural covariance. We assessed the intelligence, verbal fluency, processing speed, and executive functioning of the participants and further investigated the correlations of the GM structural networks with intelligence and cognitive functions. Six GM structural networks were identified. The cerebello-parietal component and the frontal component were significantly associated with intelligence. The parietal and frontal regions were each distinctively associated with intelligence by maintaining structural networks with the cerebellum and the temporal region, respectively. The cerebellar component was associated with visuomotor ability. Our results support the parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence by demonstrating how each core region for intelligence works in concert with other regions. In addition, we revealed how the cerebellum is associated with intelligence and cognitive functions.},

Metastasis of liver cancer is one of the most common causes of mortality. The present study showed that miR-124 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of liver cancer cells. Furthermore, chloride intracellular channel~1~(CLIC1) was identified as a novel target of miR-124 in liver cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-124 reduced CLIC1 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels in liver cancer cells. Downregulation of CLIC1 decreased the migration and invasion of liver cancer cells without affecting cell proliferation. Taken together, these results showed that CLIC1 is a critical target for miR-124-mediated inhibitory effects on cell migration and invasion. Thus, miR-124 or suppression of CLIC1 may have diagnostic value and therapeutic potential for the treatment of human liver cancer.},

However, the diagnostic value of MK in pleural effusion in NSCLC has not been well validated and established. METHODS: Samples of NSCLC-associated malignant pleural effusions (MPE) and benign effusions (BPE) were collected. The pleural fluid MK (pMK), pleural fluid adenosine deaminase (pADA), pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), pleural fluid glucose (pGLU), pleural fluid ferritin (pFER), pleural fluid CA199 (pCA199), pleural fluid CA125 (pCA125), pleural effusion white cell count (pWBC), and pleural effusion red cell count (pRBC) were analyzed, and the clinical data of each group were collected for statistical analysis. RESULT: The level of pMK, pCA125, pMK~+~pCA125, and pMK~+~pCA125~+~pADA in the MPE was significantly higher than the BPE group (P~=~.003, .000, .000, .000). The pADA level in the BPE was significantly higher than the MPE group (P~=~.003). It showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) (0.816) of jointly detection pMK, pCA125, and pADA was significantly higher than other markers for the diagnosis of MPE. Therefore, joint detection of pMK~+~pCA125~+~pADA suggested that the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC was 82.54\%, 74.19\% at the cutoff 0.47 and diagnostic performance was higher than others. CONCLUSION: Joint detection of pMK~+~pCA125~+~pADA can be used as a good indicator for the identification of MPE of NSCLC.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS In AGS and MKN28 human gastric cancer cells, SF3B1expression was inhibited with siRNA and pladienolide B. Following SF3B1 inhibition, the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay measured cell proliferation, and flow cytometry was used to investigate cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The downstream HOXA10 and AKT pathways were studied by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. The presence of alternative splicing, or differential splicing, of single-gene coding for multiple proteins, was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) SpliceSeq. RESULTS Inhibition of SF3B1 reduced the proliferation rate of AGS and MKN28 human gastric cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest. SF3B1 knockdown resulted in reduced homeobox A10 (HOXA10) mRNA expression and expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) isoforms of HOXA10 (exons 1 and 3) and HOXA10 (exons 2 and 3).

Stable addition of U2 during early spliceosome formation requires the DEAD-box ATPase PRP52-7. Yeast U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) nucleotides that form base pairs with the branch site are initially sequestered in a branchpoint-interacting stem-loop (BSL)8, but whether the human U2 snRNA folds in a similar manner is unknown. The U2 SF3B1 protein, a common mutational target in haematopoietic cancers9, contains a HEAT domain (SF3B1HEAT) with an open conformation in isolated SF3b10, but a closed conformation in spliceosomes11, which is required for stable interaction between U2 and the branch site. Here we report a 3D cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human 17S U2 snRNP at a core resolution of 4.1~\AA{} and combine it with protein crosslinking data to determine the molecular architecture of this snRNP. Our structure reveals that SF3B1HEAT interacts with PRP5 and TAT-SF1, and maintains its open conformation in U2 snRNP, and that U2 snRNA forms a BSL that is sandwiched between PRP5, TAT-SF1 and SF3B1HEAT. Thus, substantial remodelling of the BSL and displacement of BSL-interacting proteins must occur to allow formation of the U2-branch-site helix. Our studies provide a structural explanation of why TAT-SF1 must be displaced before the stable addition of U2 to the spliceosome, and identify RNP rearrangements facilitated by PRP5 that are required for stable interaction between U2 and the branch site.},

The complex is composed of presenilin (PS1 or PS2), anterior pharynx defect-1 (APH-1), nicastrin (NCT) and PEN-2 and early-onset; autosomal dominant forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are caused by inheritance of mutations of PS. No mutations in genes encoding NCT, or PEN-2 have been identified to date that cause AD. In this regard, a large genetic meta-analysis of four cohorts consisting of more than 600 000 individuals identified a common missense variant, rs117618017 in the APH1B gene that results in a T27I mutation, as a novel genome-wide significant locus. In order to confirm the findings that rs117618017 is associated with risk of AD, we performed a genetic screen from deep whole genome sequencing of the large NIMH family-based Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dataset. In parallel, we sought to uncover potential molecular mechanism(s) by which APH-1B T27I might be associated with AD by generating stable HEK293 cell lines, wherein endogenous APH-1A and APH-1B expression was silenced and into which either the wild type APH-1B or the APH-1B T27I variant was stably expressed. We then tested the impact of expressing either the wild type APH-1B or the APH-1B T27I variant on {$\gamma$}-secretase processing of human APP, the murine Notch derivative mN{$\Delta$}E and human neuregulin-1. We now report that we fail to confirm the association of rs1047552 with AD in our cohort and that cells expressing the APH-1B T27I variant show no discernable impact on the {$\gamma$}-secretase processing of established substrates compared with cells expressing wild-type APH-1B.},

  abstract = {Our previous study shows that high Chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) expression can efficiently enhance invasion and migration of gastric cancer (GC) cells in vitro. Growing evidences have found that exosomes are involved in chemotherapy resistance in several cancers including GC. We aimed to evaluate the effect of the exosome-mediated transfer of CLIC1 in the vincristine-resistance of GC. The effect of exosome-mediated transfer of CLIC1 on the development of resistance to vincristine in GC cell line SGC-7901 and the potential underlying mechanisms were investigated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), RT-PCR, and Western blotting. Exosomes were isolated from cell supernatants by differential ultracentrifugation. Comparing with SGC-7901, the expression level of CLIC1 is higher in vincristine-resistant cell line SGC-7901/VCR (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). After silencing the expression of CLIC1 by RNA interference, the half inhibition concentration (IC50) to vincristine decreased significantly in SGC-7901/VCR, and the expression of CLIC1 decreased significantly in exosomes from SGC-7901/VCR. After 48~h co-culturing with exosomes from SGC-7901/VCR, the IC50 to vincristine in SGC-7901 increased significantly, and the expression of CLIC1, P-gp, and Bcl-2 were significantly up-regulated. CLIC1 was closely associated with the resistance to vincristine in GC, and exosome-mediated transfer of CLIC1 could induce the development of resistance to vincristine in vitro. The possible mechanism was related to up-regulated P-gp and Bcl-2. However, in vivo study was needed to confirm the results in future.},

We identify 16 previously unreported loci for T2D and 1 locus for CHD, including a new T2D association at a missense variant in HLA-DRB5 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). We show that genetically mediated increase in T2D risk also confers higher CHD risk. Joint T2D-CHD analysis identified eight variants-two of which are coding-where T2D and CHD associations appear to colocalize, including a new joint T2D-CHD association at the CCDC92 locus that also replicated for T2D. The variants associated with both outcomes implicate new pathways as well as targets of existing drugs, including icosapent ethyl and adipocyte fatty-acid-binding protein.},

  abstract = {A quantitative meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association of renin-angiotensin system blockade (RASB) use with the incidence of cognitive impairment of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to October 2015. Ten studies that assessed the relationship between RASB use and the incidence of cognitive impairment of aging or AD were included. When randomized trials and observational studies were combined, the use of RASB was significantly associated with a reduced risk of AD (risk ratio [RR], 0.80; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.92) and cognitive impairment of aging (RR, 0.65; 95\% CI 0.35-0.94) compared no use of RASB. Meanwhile, in an analysis of subgroups, both subjects with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use were lower incidence of AD (RR, 0.87; 95\% CI 0.74-1.00; RR, 0.69; 95\% CI 0.44-0.93, respectively) than those without, whereas, indirect comparison between ACEI and ARB revealed no significance in the risk of AD (RR, 1.27, 95\% CI 0.85-1.89, p=0.245). In an analysis of cognitive impairment of aging, ARB use (RR, 0.40; 95\% CI 0.02-0.78), rather than ACEI use (RR, 0.72; 95\% CI 0.36-1.09), was shown to decrease the risk of cognitive impairment of aging. In conclusion, RASB treatments, regardless of the drug class, have benefits on prevention of AD, and the effects of ACEI may analogous to ARB. However, the benefit differs according to drug classes for cognitive impairment of aging, with ARB use, rather than ACEI use, being a potential treatment for reducing the incidence of cognitive impairment of aging.},

  abstract = {Pharbitidis Semen has worldwide recognition in traditional medicine for the treatment of several illnesses apart from its purgative properties, and it is also reported to show anticancer effect. However, limited pharmacological studies are available on the extract or resin glycosides fraction of Pharbitidis Semen. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of the colon cancer cell cytotoxic effect of a purified resin glycoside fraction from Pharbitidis Semen (RFP). Our results showed that the RFP-induced cell death was mediated by the caspase-independent and autophagy-protective paraptosis, a type of cell death that is characterized by the accumulation of cytoplasmic vacuoles and mitochondria swelling. RFP significantly stimulated endoplasmic reticulum stress, inhibited proteasome-dependent degradation, and activated the MAPK signaling pathway in human colon cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we found that RFP activated chloride intracellular channel-1 (CLIC1) and increased the intracellular Cl- concentration. Blockage of CLIC1 by DIDS (disodium 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate hydrate) attenuated cell death, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, suggesting that CLIC1 acts as a critical early signal in RFP-induced paraptosis. In conclusion, results obtained indicated that the cytotoxic effect of RFP in colon cancer cells was the outcome of paraptosis mediated by activation of CLIC1.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical and epidemiologic studies have shown that obesity is associated with asthma and that these associations differ by asthma subtype. Little is known about the shared genetic components between obesity and asthma. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify shared genetic associations between obesity-related traits and asthma subtypes in adults. METHODS: A cross-trait genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using 457,822 subjects of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. Experimental evidence to support the role of genes significantly associated with both obesity-related traits and asthma through a GWAS was sought by using results from obese versus lean mouse RNA sequencing and RT-PCR experiments. RESULTS: We found a substantial positive genetic correlation between body mass index and later-onset asthma defined by asthma age of onset at 16 years or greater (Rg~= 0.25, P~= 9.56~\texttimes ~10-22). Mendelian randomization analysis provided strong evidence in support of body mass index causally increasing asthma risk. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 34 shared loci among 3 obesity-related traits and 2 asthma subtypes. GWAS functional analyses identified potential causal relationships between the shared loci and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) quantitative trait loci and shared immune- and cell differentiation-related pathways between obesity and asthma. Finally, RNA sequencing data from lungs of obese versus control mice found that 2 genes (acyl-coenzyme A~oxidase-like [ACOXL] and myosin light chain 6 [MYL6]) from the cross-trait meta-analysis were differentially expressed, and these findings were validated by using RT-PCR in an independent set of mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our work identified shared genetic components between obesity-related traits and specific asthma subtypes, reinforcing the hypothesis that obesity causally increases the risk of asthma and identifying molecular pathways that might underlie both obesity and asthma.},

Thus, we aimed to investigate shared genetics and the causal link between asthma and mental health disorders.We conducted a large-scale genome-wide cross-trait association study to investigate genetic overlap between asthma from the UK Biobank and eight mental health disorders from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorder (ANX), autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia (sample size 9537-394{$\mkern1mu$}283).In the single-trait genome-wide association analysis, we replicated 130 previously reported loci and discovered 31 novel independent loci that are associated with asthma. We identified that ADHD, ANX and MDD have a strong genetic correlation with asthma at the genome-wide level. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified seven loci jointly associated with asthma and ADHD, one locus with asthma and ANX, and 10 loci with asthma and MDD. Functional analysis revealed that the identified variants regulated gene expression in major tissues belonging to the exocrine/endocrine, digestive, respiratory and haemic/immune systems. Mendelian randomisation analyses suggested that ADHD and MDD (including 6.7\% sample overlap with asthma) might increase the risk of asthma.This large-scale genome-wide cross-trait analysis identified shared genetics and potential causal links between asthma and three mental health disorders (ADHD, ANX and MDD). Such shared genetics implicate potential new biological functions that are in common among them.},

We found that inversion of the MAPT region is similarly polymorphic in other great ape species, and we present evidence that the inversions occurred independently in chimpanzees and humans. In humans, the inversion breakpoints correspond to core duplications with the LRRC37 gene family. Our analysis favors the H2 configuration and sequence haplotype as the likely great ape and human ancestral state, with inversion recurrences during primate evolution. We show that the H2 architecture has evolved more extensive sequence homology, perhaps explaining its tendency to undergo microdeletion associated with mental retardation in European populations.},

Recent studies have suggested that highly amyloidogenic Abeta(1-42) is a cause of neuronal damage leading to AD pathogenesis and that monomeric Abeta(1-40) has less neurotoxicity than Abeta(1-42). We found that mouse and human brain homogenates exhibit an enzyme activity converting Abeta(1-42) to Abeta(1-40) and that the major part of this converting activity is mediated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Purified human ACE converts Abeta(1-42) to Abeta(1-40) as well as decreases Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) ratio and degrades Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(1-40). Importantly, the treatment of Tg2576 mice with an ACE inhibitor, captopril, promotes predominant Abeta(1-42) deposition in the brain, suggesting that ACE regulates Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) ratio in vivo by converting secreted Abeta(1-42) to Abeta(1-40) and degrading Abetas. The upregulation of ACE activity can be a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.},
