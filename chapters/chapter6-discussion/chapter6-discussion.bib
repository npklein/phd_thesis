  abstract = {Background\textemdash The geographic isolation and homogeneous population of Iceland are ideally suited to ascertain clinical and genetic characteristics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) at the population level.Methods and Results\textemdash Medical records and cardiac imaging studies obtained between 1997 and 2010 were reviewed to identify Icelandic patients with HCM. Surviving patients were recruited for clinical and genetic studies. A previously identified Icelandic mutation, MYBPC3 c.927-2A{$>$}G, was genotyped, and mutation-negative samples were sequenced for HCM genes and other hypertrophic genes. Record review identified 180 patients with HCM. Genetic analyses of 151 patients defined pathogenic mutations in 101 (67\%), including MYBPC3 c.927-2A{$>$}G (88 patients, 58\%), 4 other MYBPC3 or MYH7 mutations (5 patients, 3.3\%), and 2 GLA mutations (8 patients, 5.3\%). Haplotype and genetic genealogical data defined MYBPC3 c.927-2A{$>$}G as a founder mutation, introduced into the Icelandic population in the 15th century, with a current population prevalence of 0.36\%. MYBPC3 c.927-2A{$>$}G mutation carriers exhibited phenotypic diversity but were younger at diagnosis (42 versus 49 years; P=0.001) and sustained more adverse events (15\% versus 2\%; P=0.02) than mutation-negative patients. All-cause mortality for patients with HCM was similar to that of an age-matched Icelandic population (hazard ratio, 0.98; P=0.9). HCM-related mortality (0.78\%/y) occurred at a mean age of 68 compared with 81 years for non\textendash HCM-related mortality (P=0.02).Conclusions\textemdash A founder MYBPC3 mutation that arose {$>$}550 years ago is the predominant cause of HCM in Iceland. The MYBPC3 c.927-2A{$>$}G mutation is associated with low adverse event rates but earlier cardiovascular mortality, illustrating the impact of genotype on outcomes in HCM.},

We generated \textasciitilde 14,000 progeny from crosses among 16 diverse yeast strains and identified thousands of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 38 traits. We combined our results with sequencing data for 1011 yeast isolates to show that rare variants make a disproportionate contribution to trait variation. Evolutionary analyses revealed that this contribution is driven by rare variants that arose recently, and that negative selection has shaped the relationship between variant frequency and effect size. We leveraged the structure of the crosses to resolve hundreds of QTLs to single genes. These results refine our understanding of trait variation at the population level and suggest that studies of rare variants are a fertile ground for discovery of genetic effects.},

Although many diseases are strongly heritable, individual genetic variants typically confer only a small effect on disease, and thus these diseases are strongly polygenic. Paradoxically, molecular traits, such as gene expression, methylation, protein or metabolite levels, typically have a lower heritability, but sometimes individual genetic variants show much higher effect sizes on these traits. In this review, we discuss the genetic architecture of these molecular traits, and contrast this to the genetic architecture of complex diseases, and provide explanations why strong effects of individual genetic~variants on molecular traits do not necessarily need to translate into increased risk of disease.},

  abstract = {Background RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique for the identification of genetic variants that affect gene-expression levels, either through expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping or through allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis. Given increasing numbers of RNA-seq samples in the public domain, we here studied to what extent eQTLs and ASE effects can be identified when using public RNA-seq data while deriving the genotypes from the RNA-sequencing reads themselves. Methods We downloaded the raw reads for all available human RNA-seq datasets. Using these reads we performed gene expression quantification. All samples were jointly normalized and subjected to a strict quality control. We also derived genotypes using the RNA-seq reads and used imputation to infer non-coding variants. This allowed us to perform eQTL mapping and ASE analyses jointly on all samples that passed quality control. Our results were validated using samples for which DNA-seq genotypes were available. Results 4,978 public human RNA-seq runs, representing many different tissues and cell-types, passed quality control. Even though these data originated from many different laboratories, samples reflecting the same cell type clustered together, suggesting that technical biases due to different sequencing protocols are limited. In a joint analysis on the 1,262 samples with high quality genotypes, we identified cis-eQTLs effects for 8,034 unique genes (at a false discovery rate {$\leq$}0.05). eQTL mapping on individual tissues revealed that a limited number of samples already suffice to identify tissue-specific eQTLs for known disease-associated genetic variants. Additionally, we observed strong ASE effects for 34 rare pathogenic variants, corroborating previously observed effects on the corresponding protein levels. Conclusions By deriving and imputing genotypes from RNA-seq data, it is possible to identify both eQTLs and ASE effects. Given the exponential growth of the number of publicly available RNA-seq samples, we expect this approach will become especially relevant for studying the effects of tissue-specific and rare pathogenic genetic variants to aid clinical interpretation of exome and genome sequencing.

In the past, genetic testing was rarely able to provide rapid results, but the increasing speed and availability of genomic testing is changing this, meaning that genomic information is increasingly influencing decisions around patient care in the acute inpatient setting. The landscape of treatment options for genetic conditions is shifting, which has evolving implications for clinical discussions around previously untreatable disorders.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}One of the growing problems in genome diagnostics is the increasing number of variants that get identified through genetic testing but for which it is unknown what the significance for the disease is (Variants of Unknown Significance - VUS). When these variants are observed in patients, clinicians need to be able to determine their relevance for causing the patient9s disease. Here we investigated whether allele-specific expression (ASE) can be used to prioritize disease-relevant VUS and therefore assist diagnostics. In order to do so, we conducted ASE analysis in RNA-seq data from 3,818 blood samples (part of the the Dutch BIOS biobank consortium), to ascertain how VUS affect gene expression. We compared the effect of VUS variants to variants that are predicted to have a high impact, and variants that are predicted to be pathogenic but are either recessive or autosomal-dominant with low penetrance. For immune and haematological disorders, we observed that 24.7\% of known pathogenic variants from ClinVar show allelic imbalance in blood, as compared to 6.6\% of known benign variants with matching allele frequencies. However, for other types of disorders, ASE information from blood did not distinguish (likely) pathogenic variants from benign variants. Unexpectedly, we identified 5 genes (ALOX5, COMT, PRPF8, PSTPIP1 and SH3BP2) in which seven population-based samples had a predicted high impact, autosomal-dominant variant. For these genes the imbalanced expression of the major allele compensates for the lower expression of the minor allele. Our analysis in a large population-based gene expression cohort reveals examples of high impact, autosomal-dominant variants that are compensated for by imbalanced expression. Additionally, we observed that ASE analyses in blood are informative for predicting pathogenic variants that are associated with immune and haematological conditions. We have made all our ASE results, including many ASE calls for rare variants (MAF \&lt; 1\%), available at https://molgenis15.gcc.rug.nl/.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Examining tissue-specific and population-level RNA sequencing data, Mohammadi et al. developed a statistical test, analysis of expression variation (ANEVA), that can quantify how one individual's gene expression fits in the context of the variation within the general population. By applying ANEVA to a dosage outlier test, the authors identified pathogenic gene transcripts in patients with Mendelian muscle dystrophy. Science, this issue p. 351 Transcriptome data can facilitate the interpretation of the effects of rare genetic variants. Here, we introduce ANEVA (analysis of expression variation) to quantify genetic variation in gene dosage from allelic expression (AE) data in a population. Application of ANEVA to the Genotype-Tissues Expression (GTEx) data showed that this variance estimate is robust and correlated with selective constraint in a gene. Using these variance estimates in a dosage outlier test (ANEVA-DOT) applied to AE data from 70 Mendelian muscular disease patients showed accuracy in detecting genes with pathogenic variants in previously resolved cases and led to one confirmed and several potential new diagnoses. Using our reference estimates from GTEx data, ANEVA-DOT can be incorporated in rare disease diagnostic pipelines to use RNA-sequencing data more effectively. Population-wide RNA data from patients can identify genetic outliers that correspond to candidate disease genes.

However, the promotion of a rapid elevation of O2 levels in ischemic cells produces high amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to myocardial tissue injury. This phenomenon is called ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). We aimed at identifying new and effective compounds to treat MI and minimize IRI. We previously studied heart regeneration following myocardial injury in zebrafish and described each step of the regeneration process, from the day of injury until complete recovery, in terms of transcriptional responses. Here, we mined the data and performed a deep in silico analysis to identify drugs highly likely to induce cardiac regeneration. Fisetin was identified as the top candidate. We validated its effects in an in vitro model of MI/IRI in mammalian cardiac cells. Fisetin enhances viability of rat cardiomyocytes following hypoxia/starvation \textendash{} reoxygenation. It inhibits apoptosis, decreases ROS generation and caspase activation and protects from DNA damage. Interestingly, fisetin also activates genes involved in cell proliferation. Fisetin is thus a highly promising candidate drug with clinical potential to protect from ischemic damage following MI and to overcome IRI.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}ABSTRACT{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The genotype II.4 (GII.4) variants of human noroviruses (HuNVs) are recognized as the major agent of global gastroenteritis outbreaks. Due to the lack of an efficient cell culture system for HuNV propagation, the exact roles of HuNV-encoded nonstructural proteins (including Nterm, NTPase, P22, VPg, Pro, and RdRp) in viral replication or pathogenesis have not yet been fully understood. Here, we report the molecular characterization of the GII.4 HuNV-encoded NTPase (designated GII-NTPase). Results from our studies showed that GII-NTPase forms vesicular or nonvesicular textures in the cell cytoplasm, and the nonvesicular fraction of GII-NTPase significantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria. Deletion analysis revealed that the N-terminal 179-amino-acid (aa) region of GII-NTPase is required for vesicle formation and for ER colocalization, whereas the C-terminal region is involved in mitochondrial colocalization. In particular, two mitochondrion-targeting domains were identified in the C-terminal region of GII-NTPase which perfectly colocalized with mitochondria when the N-terminal region of GII-NTPase was deleted. However, the corresponding C-terminal portions of NTPase derived from the GI HuNV did not show mitochondrial colocalization. We also found that GII-NTPase physically interacts with itself as well as with Nterm and P22, but not VPg, Pro, and RdRp, in cells. The Nterm- and P22-interacting region was mapped to the N-terminal 179-aa region of GII-NTPase, whereas the self-assembly of GII-NTPase could be achieved via a head-to-head, tail-to-tail, or head-to-tail configuration. More importantly, we demonstrate that GII-NTPase possesses a proapoptotic activity, which can be further enhanced by coexpression with Nterm or P22.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}\textbf{IMPORTANCE} Despite the importance of human norovirus GII.4 variants in global gastroenteritis outbreaks, the basic biological functions of the viral nonstructural proteins in cells remain rarely investigated. In this report, we focus our studies on characteristics of the GII.4 norovirus-encoded NTPase (GII-NTPase). We unexpectedly find that GII-NTPase can perfectly colocalize with mitochondria after its N-terminal region is deleted. However, such a phenomenon is not observed for NTPase encoded by a GI strain. We further reveal that the N-terminal 179-aa region of GII-NTPase is sufficient to mediate (i) vesicle formation, (ii) ER colocalization, (iii) the interaction with two other nonstructural proteins, including Nterm and P22, (iv) the formation of homodimers or homo-oligomers, and (v) the induction of cell apoptosis. Taken together, our findings emphasize that the virus-encoded NTPase must have multiple activities during viral replication or pathogenesis; however, these activities may vary somewhat among different genogroups.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONStrong genetic associations have been found for a number of psychiatric disorders. However, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms remains challenging. RATIONALETo address this challenge, the PsychENCODE Consortium has developed a comprehensive online resource and integrative models for the functional genomics of the human brain. RESULTSThe base of the pyramidal resource is the datasets generated by PsychENCODE, including bulk transcriptome, chromatin, genotype, and Hi-C datasets and single-cell transcriptomic data from \textasciitilde 32,000 cells for major brain regions. We have merged these with data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and single-cell analyses. Via uniform processing, we created a harmonized resource, allowing us to survey functional genomics data on the brain over a sample size of 1866 individuals.From this uniformly processed dataset, we created derived data products. These include lists of brain-expressed genes, coexpression modules, and single-cell expression profiles for many brain cell types; \textasciitilde 79,000 brain-active enhancers with associated Hi-C loops and topologically associating domains; and \textasciitilde 2.5 million expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs) comprising \textasciitilde 238,000 linkage-disequilibrium\textendash independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms and of other types of QTLs associated with splice isoforms, cell fractions, and chromatin activity. By using these, we found that {$>$}88\% of the cross-population variation in brain gene expression can be accounted for by cell fraction changes. Furthermore, a number of disorders and aging are associated with changes in cell-type proportions. The derived data also enable comparison between the brain and other tissues. In particular, by using spectral analyses, we found that the brain has distinct expression and epigenetic patterns, including a greater extent of noncoding transcription than other tissues.The top level of the resource consists of integrative networks for regulation and machine-learning models for disease prediction. The networks include a full gene regulatory network (GRN) for the brain, linking transcription factors, enhancers, and target genes from merging of the QTLs, generalized element-activity correlations, and Hi-C data. By using this network, we link disease genes to genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants for psychiatric disorders. For schizophrenia, we linked 321 genes to the 142 reported GWAS loci. We then embedded the regulatory network into a deep-learning model to predict psychiatric phenotypes from genotype and expression. Our model gives a \textasciitilde 6-fold improvement in prediction over additive polygenic risk scores. Moreover, it achieves a \textasciitilde 3-fold improvement over additive models, even when the gene expression data are imputed, highlighting the value of having just a small amount of transcriptome data for disease prediction. Lastly, it highlights key genes and pathways associated with disorder prediction, including immunological, synaptic, and metabolic pathways, recapitulating de novo results from more targeted analyses. CONCLUSIONOur resource and integrative analyses have uncovered genomic elements and networks in the brain, which in turn have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. Our deep-learning model improves disease risk prediction over traditional approaches and can be extended with additional data types (e.g., microRNA and neuroimaging). {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6420/eaat8464/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A comprehensive functional genomic resource for the adult human brain.The resource forms a three-layer pyramid. The bottom layer includes sequencing datasets for traits, such as schizophrenia. The middle layer represents derived datasets, including functional genomic elements and QTLs. The top layer contains integrated models, which link genotypes to phenotypes. DSPN, Deep Structured Phenotype Network; PC1 and PC2, principal components 1 and 2; ref, reference; alt, alternate; H3K27ac, histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27. Despite progress in defining genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Addressing this, the PsychENCODE Consortium has generated a comprehensive online resource for the adult brain across 1866 individuals. The PsychENCODE resource contains \textasciitilde 79,000 brain-active enhancers, sets of Hi-C linkages, and topologically associating domains; single-cell expression profiles for many cell types; expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs); and further QTLs associated with chromatin, splicing, and cell-type proportions. Integration shows that varying cell-type proportions largely account for the cross-population variation in expression (with {$>$}88\% reconstruction accuracy). It also allows building of a gene regulatory network, linking genome-wide association study variants to genes (e.g., 321 for schizophrenia). We embed this network into an interpretable deep-learning model, which improves disease prediction by \textasciitilde 6-fold versus polygenic risk scores and identifies key genes and pathways in psychiatric disorders.},

After sequencing 2-kb promoter regions of 472 genes in 410 healthy adults, we performed a quadratic regression of rare variant count on bins of peripheral blood transcript abundance from microarrays, summing over ranks of all genes. After adjusting for common eQTLs and the major axes of gene expression covariance, a highly significant excess of variants with minor allele frequency less than 0.05 at both high and low extremes across individuals was observed. Further enrichment was seen in sites annotated as potentially regulatory by RegulomeDB, but a deficit of effects was associated with known metabolic disease genes. The main result replicates in an independent sample of 75 individuals with RNA-seq and whole-genome sequence information. Three of four predicted large-effect sites were validated by CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown in K562 cells, but simulations indicate that effect sizes need not be unusually large to produce the observed burden. Unusually divergent low-frequency promoter haplotypes were observed at 31 loci, at least 9 of which appear to be derived from Neandertal admixture, but these were not associated with divergent gene expression in blood. The overall burden test results are consistent with rare and private regulatory variants driving high or low transcription at specific loci, potentially contributing to disease.},
