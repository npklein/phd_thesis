Answers to these questions will shed light onto the origin of human disorders (e.g., [4]) and help to predict the population frequencies of alleles that contribute to disease risk, with important implications for the efficient design of mapping studies 5, 6, 7. As a first step toward addressing these questions, we created a hand-curated version of the Mendelian Inheritance in Man database (OMIM). We then examined selective pressures on Mendelian-disease genes, genes that contribute to complex-disease risk, and genes known to be essential in mouse by analyzing patterns of human polymorphism and of divergence between human and rhesus macaque. We found that Mendelian-disease genes appear to be under widespread purifying selection, especially when the disease mutations are dominant (rather than recessive). In contrast, the class of genes that influence complex-disease risk shows little signs of evolutionary conservation, possibly because this category includes targets of both purifying and positive selection.},

New developments in genotyping techniques and bioinformatics, enabling detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, already provide physicians and scientists with tools that change our understanding of human biology. In the near future, studies will relate genetic polymorphisms to features of critical illnesses, increased susceptibility to common diseases, and altered response to therapy. Novel insights into the contribution of genetic factors to critical illnesses and advances in pharmacogenomics will be used to select the most effective therapeutic agent and the optimal dosage required to elicit the expected drug response for a given individual. Implementation of genetic criteria for patient selection and individual assessment of the risks and benefits of treatment emerges as a major challenge to the pharmaceutical industry.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic whole-genome sequencing has been explored in critically ill newborns, hoping to improve their clinical care and replace time-consuming and/or invasive diagnostic testing. A previous retrospective study in a research setting showed promising results with diagnoses in 57\%, but patients were highly selected for known and likely Mendelian disorders. The aim of our prospective study was to assess the speed and yield of rapid targeted genomic diagnostics for clinical application.
METHODS: We included 23 critically ill children younger than 12 months in ICUs over a period of 2 years. A quick diagnosis could not be made after routine clinical evaluation and diagnostics. Targeted analysis of 3426 known disease genes was performed by using whole-genome sequencing data. We measured diagnostic yield, turnaround times, and clinical consequences.
RESULTS: A genetic diagnosis was obtained in 7 patients (30\%), with a median turnaround time of 12 days (ranging from 5 to 23 days). We identified compound heterozygous mutations in the EPG5 gene (Vici syndrome), the RMND1 gene (combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-11), and the EIF2B5 gene (vanishing white matter), and homozygous mutations in the KLHL41 gene (nemaline myopathy), the GFER gene (progressive mitochondrial myopathy), and the GLB1 gene (GM1-gangliosidosis). In addition, a 1p36.33p36.32 microdeletion was detected in a child with cardiomyopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid targeted genomics combined with copy number variant detection adds important value in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care setting. It led to a fast diagnosis in 30\% of critically ill children for whom the routine clinical workup was unsuccessful.},

The project exemplifies the power, necessity and success of large, integrated, cross-disciplinary efforts - so-called `big science' - directed towards complex major objectives. In this article, we discuss the ways in which this ambitious endeavor led to the development of novel technologies and analytical tools, and how it brought the expertise of engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians together with biologists. It established an open approach to data sharing and open-source software, thereby making the data resulting from the project accessible to all. The genome sequences of microbes, plants and animals have revolutionized many fields of science, including microbiology, virology, infectious disease and plant biology. Moreover, deeper knowledge of human sequence variation has begun to alter the practice of medicine. The Human Genome Project has inspired subsequent large-scale data acquisition initiatives such as the International HapMap Project, 1000 Genomes, and The Cancer Genome Atlas, as well as the recently announced Human Brain Project and the emerging Human Proteome Project.},

Extended haplotype data based on DNA markers closely linked to the putative disease gene locus suggest that the remainder of the cystic fibrosis mutant gene pool consists of multiple, different mutations. A small set of these latter mutant alleles (about 8 percent) may confer residual pancreatic exocrine function in a subgroup of patients who are pancreatic sufficient. The ability to detect mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene at the DNA level has important implications for genetic diagnosis.},

  abstract = {The Estonian Genome Project (EGP) is a large population-based databank that was established with health records and biological samples from a large portion of the population for use in biomedical and genetic research to improve the future of public health care in Estonia. A nonprofit foundation, the Estonian Genome Foundation presented the EGP to the Estonian government in June 2000 leading to a new legislative act, the ``Human Genes Research Act,'' that provides a road map for future gene-related activities and guidelines for the oversight of the databank via a Supervisory Board, Ethics Committee, and Scientific Advisory Board. Unlike other gene discovery efforts, participants in population-based projects are not selected by specific disease type but rather via a random sampling process. The unbiased nature of the recruitment process provides a more accurate measure of the disease risk provided by particular genetic variants and is anticipated to collect 100,000 samples by the end of 2007. The EGP is part of the first international consortia, P3G, set up between Cart@gene from Canada and GenomEUtwin, a FP5-funded project coordinated by the University of Helsinki, Finland. With Estonia joining the European Union in 2004, the EGP will also function to build scientific excellence in Estonia. Drug Dev.

  abstract = {Background:Relative risk reduction with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial\textendash Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk reduction among a subgroup at high genetic risk. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high genetic risk had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.Methods:We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic risk score derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high genetic risk (top quintile of polygenic risk score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic risk score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).Results:Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high genetic risk, statin therapy was associated with a relative risk reduction of 44\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 22\textendash 60; P{$<$}0.001), whereas in all others, the relative risk reduction was 24\% (95\% CI, 8\textendash 37; P=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative risk reduction in those at high genetic risk was 46\% versus 26\% in all others (P for heterogeneity=0.05). Across all 3 studies, the absolute risk reduction with statin therapy was 3.6\% (95\% CI, 2.0\textendash 5.1) among those in the high genetic risk group and 1.3\% (95\% CI, 0.6\textendash 1.9) in all others. Each 1-SD increase in the polygenic risk score was associated with 1.32-fold (95\% CI, 1.04\textendash 1.68) greater likelihood of having coronary artery calcification and 9.7\% higher (95\% CI, 2.2\textendash 17.8) burden of carotid plaque.Conclusions:Those at high genetic risk have a greater burden of subclinical atherosclerosis and derive greater relative and absolute benefit from statin therapy to prevent a first coronary heart disease event.Clinical Trial Registration:URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifiers: NCT00738725 (BioImage) and NCT00005130 (CARDIA). WOSCOPS was carried out and completed before the requirement for clinical trial registration.},
