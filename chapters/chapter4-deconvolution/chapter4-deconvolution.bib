  abstract = {Effective immunity requires a complex network of cellular and humoral components that interact with each other and are influenced by different environmental and host factors. We used a systems biology approach to comprehensively assess the impact of environmental and genetic factors on immune cell populations in peripheral blood, including associations with immunoglobulin concentrations, from {$\sim$}500 healthy volunteers from the Human Functional Genomics Project. Genetic heritability estimation showed that variations in T~cell numbers are more strongly driven by genetic factors, while B cell counts are more environmentally influenced. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping identified eight independent genomic loci associated with leukocyte count variation, including four associations with T and B cell subtypes. The QTLs identified were enriched among genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs reported to increase susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases. Our systems approach provides insights into cellular and humoral immune trait variability in humans.},

We carried out high-resolution genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic profiling in three major human immune cell types (CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ neutrophils, and naive CD4+ T~cells) from up to 197 individuals. We assess, quantitatively, the relative contribution of cis-genetic and epigenetic factors to transcription and evaluate their impact as potential sources of confounding in epigenome-wide association studies. Further, we characterize highly coordinated genetic effects on gene expression, methylation, and histone variation through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and allele-specific (AS) analyses. Finally, we demonstrate colocalization of molecular trait QTLs at 345 unique immune disease loci. This expansive, high-resolution atlas of multi-omics changes yields insights into cell-type-specific correlation between diverse genomic inputs, more generalizable correlations between these inputs, and defines molecular events that may underpin complex disease risk.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\textemdash{}We conducted a cross-sectional study of 3,068 men and women, aged 20\textendash{}65 years, without known diabetes who were fasting participants of a population-based study in three Dutch towns. Hyperglycemia was defined as a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 6.1 mmol/l (American Diabetes Association criterion). Waist circumference was categorized according to previously defined waist action levels. All estimates were adjusted for age and town.
RESULTS\textemdash{}The regression coefficients for the association between waist circumference and fasting plasma glucose were larger in participants who had a parental history of diabetes than in those who did not (men {$\beta$} = 0.31 vs. 0.16 mmol/SD, P [for interaction] = 0.003; women {$\beta$} = 0.24 vs. 0.11 mmol/SD, P = 0.002). Furthermore, larger waist circumference (men {$\geq$}94 vs. {$<$}94 cm, women {$\geq$}88 vs. {$<$}80 cm) was associated with a greater excess prevalence of hyperglycemia in participants who had a parental history of diabetes than in those who did not (men 12.4 vs. 2.0\%, P = 0.03; women 13.6 vs. 5.9\%, P = 0.05). Adjustment for physical activity, alcohol intake, smoking, and educational level did not materially change the results.
CONCLUSIONS\textemdash{}These findings indicate that the association between abdominal obesity and hyperglycemia is stronger in the presence of a parental history of diabetes. Blood glucose screening may be warranted at lower levels of waist circumference in individuals with a parental history of diabetes.},

  abstract = {Adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ with a role in many cardiometabolic diseases. It is comprised of a heterogeneous collection of cell types that can differentially impact disease phenotypes. Cellular heterogeneity can also confound -omic analyses but is rarely taken into account in analysis of solid-tissue transcriptomes. Here, we investigate cell-type heterogeneity in two population-level subcutaneous adipose-tissue RNA-seq datasets (TwinsUK, n = 766 and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project [GTEx], n = 326) by estimating the relative proportions of four distinct cell types (adipocytes, macrophages, CD4+ T~cells, and micro-vascular endothelial cells). We find significant cellular heterogeneity within and between the TwinsUK and GTEx adipose datasets. We find that adipose cell-type composition is heritable and confirm the positive association between adipose-resident macrophage proportion and obesity (high BMI), but we find a stronger BMI-independent association with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) derived body-fat distribution traits. We benchmark the impact of adipose-tissue cell composition on a range of standard analyses, including phenotype-gene expression association, co-expression networks, and cis-eQTL discovery. Our results indicate that it is critical to account for cell-type composition when combining adipose transcriptome datasets in co-expression analysis and in differential expression analysis with obesity-related traits. We applied gene expression by cell-type proportion interaction models (G \texttimes{} Cell) to identify 26 cell-type-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in 20 genes, including four autoimmune disease genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci. These results identify cell-specific eQTLs and demonstrate the potential of in silico deconvolution of bulk tissue to identify cell-type-restricted regulatory variants.},

  abstract = {Eur J Clin Invest 2011; 41 (4): 372\textendash{}379 Abstract Background Complement C3, a central component of the innate immune system is increased in subjects with obesity and type 2 diabetes and is a novel risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that the strong association between insulin resistance and circulating amounts of C3 may be related to hepatic fat accumulation -independent of central obesity itself and of a general low-grade inflammatory response. Research question To what extent is the association between insulin resistance and C3 explained by plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as a surrogate of hepatic fat accumulation. Methods Cross-sectional analyses conducted in the Cohort on Diabetes and Atherosclerosis Maastricht (CODAM) study. Analyses were restricted to subjects with none-to-moderate alcohol consumption (n = 453, 61{$\cdot$}4\% men). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate the association between HOMA2IR (main determinant) and circulating complement C3 (main outcome), and the mediating role of ALT herein. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus or heart disease, use of medication, smoking, alcohol consumption, waist circumference and inflammation. Results Insulin resistance (estimated as HOMA2IR) was strongly associated with circulating C3 (standardized regression coefficient {$\beta$} 0{$\cdot$}40 [95\% CI: 0{$\cdot$}30; 0{$\cdot$}49]) and also with ALT ({$\beta$} 0{$\cdot$}44 [0{$\cdot$}34; 0{$\cdot$}54]), both adjusted for the above-mentioned covariates. The association between HOMA2IR and C3 was attenuated after further adjustment for ALT ({$\beta$} decreased to 0{$\cdot$}34 [0{$\cdot$}24; 0{$\cdot$}44]). Concluding Remarks Plasma ALT can explain 14{$\cdot$}2\% of the strong association between insulin resistance and circulating concentrations of complement C3, independent of central obesity and general inflammation.},

Among 20 genomic annotation sets, reported TASs were significantly overrepresented only in nonsynonymous sites [OR = 3.9 (2.2-7.0), p = 3.5 \texttimes{} 10-7] and 5kb-promoter regions [OR = 2.3 (1.5-3.6), p = 3 \texttimes{} 10-4] compared to SNPs randomly selected from genotyping arrays. Although 88\% of TASs were intronic (45\%) or intergenic (43\%), TASs were not overrepresented in introns and were significantly depleted in intergenic regions [OR = 0.44 (0.34-0.58), p = 2.0 \texttimes{} 10-9]. Only slightly more TASs than expected by chance were predicted to be in regions under positive selection [OR = 1.3 (0.8-2.1), p = 0.2]. This new online resource, together with bioinformatic predictions of the underlying functionality at trait/disease-associated loci, is well-suited to guide future investigations of the role of common variants in complex disease etiology.},

  abstract = {Genotype imputation methods are now being widely used in the analysis of genome-wide association studies. Most imputation analyses to date have used the HapMap as a reference dataset, but new reference panels (such as controls genotyped on multiple SNP chips and densely typed samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project) will soon allow a broader range of SNPs to be imputed with higher accuracy, thereby increasing power. We describe a genotype imputation method (IMPUTE version 2) that is designed to address the challenges presented by these new datasets. The main innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling framework that increases accuracy and combines information across multiple reference panels while remaining computationally feasible. We find that IMPUTE v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods when the HapMap provides the sole reference panel, but that the size of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made. We also find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by expanding the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes and that IMPUTE v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at both rare and common SNPs, with overall error rates that are 15\%\textendash{}20\% lower than those of the closest competing method. One particularly challenging aspect of next-generation association studies is to integrate information across multiple reference panels genotyped on different sets of SNPs; we show that our approach to this problem has practical advantages over other suggested solutions.},

The vast majority of interactions are uncharted, constituting a major missing link in understanding genome control. Here, we use promoter capture Hi-C to identify interacting regions of 31,253 promoters in 17 human primary hematopoietic cell types. We show that promoter interactions are highly cell type specific and enriched for links between active promoters and epigenetically marked enhancers. Promoter interactomes reflect lineage relationships of the hematopoietic tree, consistent with dynamic remodeling of nuclear architecture during differentiation. Interacting regions are enriched in genetic variants linked with altered expression of genes they contact, highlighting their functional role. We exploit this rich resource to connect non-coding disease variants to putative target promoters, prioritizing thousands of disease-candidate genes and implicating disease pathways. Our results demonstrate the power of primary cell promoter interactomes to reveal insights into genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying common diseases.,

Identifying genetic variants that affect gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs) is crucial to addressing this. eQTLs vary between tissues and following in vitro cellular activation, but have not been examined in the context of human inflammatory diseases. We performed eQTL mapping in five primary immune cell types from patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (n = 91), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 43), revealing eQTLs present only in the context of active inflammatory disease. Moreover, we show that following treatment a proportion of these eQTLs disappear. Through joint analysis of expression data from multiple cell types, we reveal that previous estimates of eQTL immune cell-type specificity are likely to have been exaggerated. Finally, by analysing gene expression data from multiple cell types, we find eQTLs not previously identified by database mining at 34 inflammatory bowel disease-associated loci. In summary, this parallel eQTL analysis in multiple leucocyte subsets from patients with active disease provides new insights into the genetic basis of immune-mediated diseases.},

  abstract = {Immunogenetic Variation
Many genetic variants have been implicated in disease but their effects in function across tissues and cell-types remain to be resolved. Raj et al. (p. 519) present an analysis of expression quantative trait loci (eQTL) measuring messenger RNA levels and examined correlations between genotypes and gene expression in purified monocytes and T cells in healthy individuals of European, African, and Asian descent. Most, but not all, of the eQTLs and their effects on expression were shared between the populations, as well as a substantial proportion between the cell types. Links were found with disease-associated variants and loci that previous genome-wide analyses have implicated in neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases.
To extend our understanding of the genetic basis of human immune function and dysfunction, we performed an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study of purified CD4+ T cells and monocytes, representing adaptive and innate immunity, in a multi-ethnic cohort of 461 healthy individuals. Context-specific cis- and trans-eQTLs were identified, and cross-population mapping allowed, in some cases, putative functional assignment of candidate causal regulatory variants for disease-associated loci. We note an over-representation of T cell\textendash{}specific eQTLs among susceptibility alleles for autoimmune diseases and of monocyte-specific eQTLs among Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease variants. This polarization implicates specific immune cell types in these diseases and points to the need to identify the cell-autonomous effects of disease susceptibility variants.
Genetic variants affecting gene expression show both shared and specific immune cell type effects.

  abstract = {We conducted a sib pair study in very old subjects for the purpose of mapping longevity loci. In the present analysis, we explore whether our recruitment strategy has resulted in a population enriched for a heritable component for exceptional longevity. Our study includes families with at least two long-living siblings (men aged 89 years or above; women aged 91 years or above). Data were collected on date of birth and, if applicable, date of death of parents, brothers and sisters, offspring, and spouses of the long-living participants. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) compared with the general Dutch population, were calculated. The SMR for all siblings of the long-living participants was 0.66 (95\% CI 0.60\textendash{}0.73). A similar survival benefit was also observed in the parents (SMR=0.76, 95\% CI 0.66\textendash{}0.87) and in the offspring of the long-living subjects (SMR=0.65, 95\% CI 0.51\textendash{}0.80). The SMR of the spouses of the long-living subjects was 0.95 (95\% CI 0.82\textendash{}1.12). The familial clustering of extended survival is unlikely to be caused by ascertainment bias, because in all analyses the long-living participants were excluded. Moreover, it is also unlikely to be caused by environmental factors, because the spouses of the long-living participants had a mortality risk comparable with the general Dutch population, whereas they share the same environment. We conclude that our sample is genetically enriched for extreme survival.},

  abstract = {Purpose There is a critical need for population-based prospective cohort studies because they follow individuals before the onset of disease, allowing for studies that can identify biomarkers and disease-modifying effects, and thereby contributing to systems epidemiology.
Participants This paper describes the design and baseline characteristics of an intensively examined subpopulation of the LifeLines cohort in the Netherlands. In this unique subcohort, LifeLines DEEP, we included 1539 participants aged 18 years and older.
Findings to date We collected additional blood (n=1387), exhaled air (n=1425) and faecal samples (n=1248), and elicited responses to gastrointestinal health questionnaires (n=1176) for analysis of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, microbiome, metabolome and other biological levels. Here, we provide an overview of the different data layers in LifeLines DEEP and present baseline characteristics of the study population including food intake and quality of life. We also describe how the LifeLines DEEP cohort allows for the detailed investigation of genetic, genomic and metabolic variation for a wide range of phenotypic outcomes. Finally, we examine the determinants of gastrointestinal health, an area of particular interest to us that can be addressed by LifeLines DEEP.
Future plans We have established a cohort of which multiple data levels allow for the integrative analysis of populations for translation of this information into biomarkers for disease, and which will offer new insights into disease mechanisms and prevention.},

While trait-associated variants may operate in a cell-type specific manner, eQTL datasets for such cell-types may not always be available. We performed a genome-environment interaction (GxE) meta-analysis on data from 5,683 samples to infer the cell type specificity of whole blood cis-eQTLs. We demonstrate that this method is able to predict neutrophil and lymphocyte specific cis-eQTLs and replicate these predictions in independent cell-type specific datasets. Finally, we show that SNPs associated with Crohn's disease preferentially affect gene expression within neutrophils, including the archetypal NOD2 locus.},

Between January 2004 and July 2008, adult participants from NTR research projects were invited into the study. During a home visit between 7:00 and 10:00 am, fasting blood and morning urine samples were collected. Fertile women were bled on day 2\textendash{}4 of the menstrual cycle, or in their pill-free week. Biological samples were collected for DNA isolation, gene expression studies, creation of cell lines and for biomarker assessment. At the time of blood sampling, additional phenotypic information concerning health, medication use, body composition and smoking was collected. Of the participants contacted, 69\% participated. Blood and urine samples were collected in 9,530 participants (63\% female, average age 44.4 (SD 15.5) years) from 3,477 families. Lipid profile, glucose, insulin, HbA1c, haematology, CRP, fibrinogen, liver enzymes and creatinine have been assessed. Longitudinal survey data on health, personality and lifestyle are currently available for 90\% of all participants. Genome-wide SNP data are available for 3,524 participants, with additional genotyping ongoing. The NTR biobank, combined with the extensive phenotypic information available within the NTR, provides a valuable resource for the study of genetic determinants of individual differences in mental and physical health. It offers opportunities for DNA-based and gene expression studies as well as for future metabolomic and proteomic projects.},

Computational methods have been developed for eQTL mapping using gene expression data from microarray or RNA-seq technology. Application of these methods for eQTL mapping in tumor tissues is problematic because tumor tissues are composed of both tumor and infiltrating normal cells (e.g., immune cells) and eQTL effects may vary between tumor and infiltrating normal cells. To address this challenge, we have developed a new method for eQTL mapping using RNA-seq data from tumor samples. Our method separately estimates the eQTL effects in tumor and infiltrating normal cells using both total expression and allele-specific expression (ASE). We demonstrate that our method controls Type I error rate and has higher power than some alternative approaches. We applied our method to study RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and illustrated the similarities and differences of eQTL effects in tumor and normal cells. Supplementary materials for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.},

The comparison results show that the convergence rate of the preconditioned GAOR methods is indeed better than the rate of the original method, whenever the original method is convergent.
