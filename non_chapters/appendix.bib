  abstract = {Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies are used to interpret the function of disease-associated genetic risk factors. To date, most eQTL analyses have been conducted in bulk tissues, such as whole blood and tissue biopsies, which are likely to mask the cell type-context of the eQTL regulatory effects. Although this context can be investigated by generating transcriptional profiles from purified cell subpopulations, current methods to do this are labor-intensive and expensive. We introduce a new method, Decon2, as a framework for estimating cell proportions using expression profiles from bulk blood samples (Decon-cell) followed by deconvolution of cell type eQTLs (Decon-eQTL).},

  abstract = {Celiac disease is an auto-immune disease in which an immune response to dietary gluten leads to inflammation and subsequent atrophy of small intestinal villi, causing severe bowel discomfort and malabsorption of nutrients. The major instigating factor for the immune response in celiac disease is the activation of gluten-specific CD4+ T cells expressing T cell receptors that recognize gluten peptides presented in the context of HLA-DQ2 and DQ8. Here we provide an in-depth characterization of 28 gluten-specific T cell clones. We assess their transcriptional and epigenetic response to T cell receptor stimulation and link this to genetic factors associated with celiac disease. Gluten-specific T cells have a distinct transcriptional profile that mostly resembles that of Th1 cells but also express cytokines characteristic of other types of T-helper cells. This transcriptional response appears not to be regulated by changes in chromatin state, but rather by early upregulation of transcription factors and non-coding RNAs that likely orchestrate the subsequent activation of genes that play a role in immune pathways.~Finally, integration of chromatin and transcription factor binding profiles suggest that genes activated by T cell receptor stimulation of gluten-specific T cells may be impacted by genetic variation at several genetic loci associated with celiac disease.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background: Genetic testing in patients with suspected hereditary kidney disease may not reveal the genetic cause for the disorder as potentially pathogenic variants can reside in genes that are not yet known to be involved in kidney disease. To help identify these genes, we have developed KidneyNetwork, that utilizes tissue-specific expression to predict kidney-specific gene functions. Methods: KidneyNetwork is a co-expression network built upon a combination of 878 kidney RNA-sequencing samples and a multi-tissue dataset of 31,499 samples. It uses expression patterns to predict which genes have a kidney-related function and which (disease) phenotypes might result from variants in these genes. We applied KidneyNetwork to prioritize rare variants in exome sequencing data from 13 kidney disease patients without a genetic diagnosis. Results: KidneyNetwork can accurately predict kidney-specific gene functions and (kidney disease) phenotypes for disease-associated genes. Applying it to exome sequencing data of kidney disease patients allowed us to identify a promising candidate gene for kidney and liver cysts: ALG6. Conclusion: We present KidneyNetwork, a kidney-specific co-expression network that accurately predicts which genes have kidney-specific functions and can result in kidney disease. We show the added value of KidneyNetwork by applying it to kidney disease patients without a molecular diagnosis and consequently, we propose ALG6 as candidate gene in one of these patients. KidneyNetwork can be applied to clinically unsolved kidney disease cases, but it can also be used by researchers to gain insight into individual genes in order to better understand kidney physiology and pathophysiology.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Although many diseases are strongly heritable, individual genetic variants typically confer only a small effect on disease, and thus these diseases are strongly polygenic. Paradoxically, molecular traits, such as gene expression, methylation, protein or metabolite levels, typically have a lower heritability, but sometimes individual genetic variants show much higher effect sizes on these traits. In this review, we discuss the genetic architecture of these molecular traits, and contrast this to the genetic architecture of complex diseases, and provide explanations why strong effects of individual genetic~variants on molecular traits do not necessarily need to translate into increased risk of disease.},

In~particular, a gene-dense locus on chromosome 11 (61.5\textendash 61.65 Mb) has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and coronary artery disease. Here, we identify TMEM258 within this locus as a central regulator of intestinal inflammation. Strikingly, Tmem258 haploinsufficient mice exhibit severe intestinal inflammation in a model of colitis. At the mechanistic level, we demonstrate that TMEM258 is a required component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex and is essential for N-linked protein glycosylation. Consequently, homozygous deficiency of Tmem258 in colonic organoids results in unresolved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress culminating in apoptosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TMEM258 is a central mediator of ER quality control and intestinal homeostasis.},

Intake of these beverages is consistently linked to, among others, reduced risk of diabetes and liver diseases; however, the mechanisms of action remain elusive. Epigenetics is suggested as a mechanism mediating the effects of dietary and lifestyle factors on disease onset. Here we report the results from epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) on coffee and tea consumption in 15,789 participants of European and African-American ancestries from 15 cohorts. EWAS meta-analysis of coffee consumption reveals 11 CpGs surpassing the epigenome-wide significance threshold (P-value {$<$}1.1\texttimes 10-7), which annotated to the AHRR, F2RL3, FLJ43663, HDAC4, GFI1 and PHGDH genes. Among them, cg14476101 is significantly associated with expression of the PHGDH and risk of fatty liver disease. Knockdown of PHGDH expression in liver cells shows a correlation with expression levels of genes associated with circulating lipids, suggesting a role of PHGDH in hepatic-lipid metabolism. EWAS meta-analysis on tea consumption reveals no significant association, only two CpGs annotated to CACNA1A and PRDM16 genes show suggestive association (P-value {$<$}5.0\texttimes 10-6).

  abstract = {Background DNA methylation at the GFI1-locus has been repeatedly associated with exposure to smoking from the foetal period onwards. We explored whether DNA methylation may be a mechanism that links exposure to maternal prenatal smoking with offspring's adult cardio-metabolic health. Methods We meta-analysed the association between DNA methylation at GFI1-locus with maternal prenatal smoking, adult own smoking, and cardio-metabolic phenotypes in 22 population-based studies from Europe, Australia, and USA (n = 18,212). DNA methylation at the GFI1-locus was measured in whole-blood. Multivariable regression models were fitted to examine its association with exposure to prenatal and own adult smoking. DNA methylation levels were analysed in relation to body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), fasting glucose (FG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL\textemdash C), triglycerides (TG), diastolic, and systolic blood pressure (BP). Findings Lower DNA methylation at three out of eight GFI1-CpGs was associated with exposure to maternal prenatal smoking, whereas, all eight CpGs were associated with adult own smoking. Lower DNA methylation at cg14179389, the strongest maternal prenatal smoking locus, was associated with increased WC and BP when adjusted for sex, age, and adult smoking with Bonferroni-corrected P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}012. In contrast, lower DNA methylation at cg09935388, the strongest adult own smoking locus, was associated with decreased BMI, WC, and BP (adjusted 1 \texttimes{} 10-7 {$<$} P {$<$} 0.01). Similarly, lower DNA methylation at cg12876356, cg18316974, cg09662411, and cg18146737 was associated with decreased BMI and WC (5 \texttimes{} 10-8 {$<$} P {$<$} 0.001). Lower DNA methylation at all the CpGs was consistently associated with higher TG levels. Interpretation Epigenetic changes at the GFI1 were linked to smoking exposure in-utero/in-adulthood and robustly associated with cardio-metabolic risk factors.

We conducted a cross-ancestry GWAS in ALS including 29,612 ALS patients and 122,656 controls which identified 15 risk loci in ALS. When combined with 8,953 whole-genome sequenced individuals (6,538 ALS patients, 2,415 controls) and the largest cortex-derived eQTL dataset (MetaBrain), analyses revealed locus-specific genetic architectures in which we prioritized genes either through rare variants, repeat expansions or regulatory effects. ALS associated risk loci were shared with multiple traits within the neurodegenerative spectrum, but with distinct enrichment patterns across brain regions and cell-types. Across environmental and life-style risk factors obtained from literature, Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a causal role for high cholesterol levels. All ALS associated signals combined reveal a role for perturbations in vesicle mediated transport and autophagy, and provide evidence for cell-autonomous disease initiation in glutamatergic neurons.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The zebrafish has the capacity to regenerate its heart after severe injury. While the function of a few genes during this process has been studied, we are far from fully understanding how genes interact to coordinate heart regeneration. To enable systematic insights into this phenomenon, we generated and integrated a dynamic co-expression network of heart regeneration in the zebrafish and linked systems-level properties to the underlying molecular events. Across multiple post-injury time points, the network displays topological attributes of biological relevance. We show that regeneration steps are mediated by modules of transcriptionally coordinated genes, and by genes acting as network hubs. We also established direct associations between hubs and validated drivers of heart regeneration with murine and human orthologs. The resulting models and interactive analysis tools are available at http://infused.vital-it.ch. Using a worked example, we demonstrate the usefulness of this unique open resource for hypothesis generation and in silico screening for genes involved in heart regeneration.},

  abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Reperfusion is considered as an optimal therapy following cardiac ischemia. However, the promotion of a rapid elevation of O2 levels in ischemic cells produces high amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to myocardial tissue injury. This phenomenon is called ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). We aimed at identifying new and effective compounds to treat MI and minimize IRI. We previously studied heart regeneration following myocardial injury in zebrafish and described each step of the regeneration process, from the day of injury until complete recovery, in terms of transcriptional responses. Here, we mined the data and performed a deep in silico analysis to identify drugs highly likely to induce cardiac regeneration. Fisetin was identified as the top candidate. We validated its effects in an in vitro model of MI/IRI in mammalian cardiac cells. Fisetin enhances viability of rat cardiomyocytes following hypoxia/starvation \textendash{} reoxygenation. It inhibits apoptosis, decreases ROS generation and caspase activation and protects from DNA damage. Interestingly, fisetin also activates genes involved in cell proliferation. Fisetin is thus a highly promising candidate drug with clinical potential to protect from ischemic damage following MI and to overcome IRI.},

  abstract = {Allele specific expression (ASE) concerns divergent expression quantity of alternative alleles and is measured by RNA sequencing. Multiple studies show that ASE plays a role in hereditary diseases by modulating penetrance or phenotype severity. However, genome diagnostics is based on DNA sequencing and therefore neglects gene expression regulation such as ASE. To take advantage of ASE in absence of RNA sequencing, it must be predicted using only DNA variation. We have constructed ASE models from BIOS (n = 3432) and GTEx (n = 369) that predict ASE using DNA features. These models are highly reproducible and comprise many different feature types, highlighting the complex regulation that underlies ASE. We applied the BIOS-trained model to population variants in three genes in which ASE plays a clinically relevant role: BRCA2, RET and NF1. This resulted in predicted ASE effects for 27 variants, of which 10 were known pathogenic variants. We demonstrated that ASE can be predicted from DNA features using machine learning. Future efforts may improve sensitivity and translate these models into a new type of genome diagnostic tool that prioritizes candidate pathogenic variants or regulators thereof for follow-up validation by RNA sequencing. All used code and machine learning models are available at GitHub and Zenodo.},
